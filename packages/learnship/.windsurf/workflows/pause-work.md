description: Save a handoff file when stopping mid-phase so you can resume seamlessly later

# Pause Work

Create a `.continue-here.md` handoff file that captures complete work state. Enables seamless resumption with full context restoration.

**Use when:** stopping mid-plan, mid-phase, or any time you want to preserve exact position.

## Step 1: Detect Current Phase

Find the most recently active phase:
```bash
node -e "const fs=require('fs'),path=require('path');function find(d){let r=[];try{for(const e of fs.readdirSync(d,{withFileTypes:true})){const f=path.join(d,e.name);r=r.concat(e.isDirectory()?find(f):e.name.endsWith('-PLAN.md')?[f]:[]);}}catch(e){}return r;}const files=find('.planning/phases').map(f=>({f,t:fs.statSync(f).mtimeMs})).sort((a,b)=>b.t-a.t);if(files[0])console.log(files[0].f);"
```

Extract the phase directory name from the result.

If no active phase detected, ask: "Which phase are you pausing work on?"

## Step 2: Gather State

Collect the complete handoff state by reading current files:

```bash
cat ".planning/phases/[phase_dir]/"*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
cat .planning/STATE.md
```

Also ask the user (conversationally) for anything that can't be inferred from files:
- Which specific task were you on?
- What's already completed vs. what's in progress?
- Any key decisions made this session that aren't yet committed?
- Any blockers or things to watch out for?
- What's the very first thing to do when resuming?

## Step 3: Write Handoff File

Write `.planning/phases/[phase_dir]/.continue-here.md`:

```markdown
---
phase: [phase_dir]
task: [current task number]
total_tasks: [total tasks in current plan]
status: in_progress
last_updated: [ISO timestamp]
---

<current_state>
[Where exactly are we? Phase X, Plan Y, Task Z — immediate context for a fresh session]
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Task 1: [name] — Done
- Task 2: [name] — Done
- Task 3: [name] — In progress, [what's done so far]
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Task 3: [what's left to complete]
- Task 4: Not started
- Task 5: Not started
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Decided to use [X] because [reason]
- Chose [approach] over [alternative] because [reason]
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- [Any blocker]: [status or workaround]
</blockers>

<context>
[The mental model: what approach is being taken, why, what to watch out for]
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: [the specific first action to take when resuming — be precise]
</next_action>
```

Be specific enough that a fresh Cascade session can pick up immediately without re-asking.

## Step 4: Commit

```bash
git add ".planning/phases/[phase_dir]/.continue-here.md"
git commit -m "wip: [phase-name] paused at task [X]/[Y]"
```

## Step 5: Confirm

```
✓ Handoff created: .planning/phases/[phase_dir]/.continue-here.md

Current state:
- Phase: [phase_dir]
- Task: [X] of [Y]
- Status: in_progress
- Committed as WIP

▶ To resume: resume-work
```

## Learning Checkpoint

Read `learning_mode` from `.planning/config.json`.

**If `auto`:** Offer before the session ends:

> 💡 **Before you go:** Session transitions are when learning decays fastest. Two minutes now saves re-learning later:
>
> `@agentic-learning space` — Identify what was covered this session and schedule it for spaced review. Writes to `docs/revisit.md`. When you resume, you'll start sharper.
>
> `@agentic-learning reflect` — Quick 3-part reflection: what was built this session, what was the intent, what still feels uncertain. Takes 3 minutes, pays off when you return.

**If `manual`:** Add quietly: *"Tip: `@agentic-learning space` before closing to schedule what you worked on for review."*
