# Progress

Check where you are in the project, what's been done, and what comes next.

## Step 1: Check for Planning Structure

```bash
node -e "const fs=require('fs'); console.log(fs.existsSync('.planning/PROJECT.md') ? 'EXISTS' : 'MISSING')"
```

If `.planning/` doesn't exist: stop — run `new-project` to initialize.

## Step 2: Load Context

Read the key state files:
```bash
cat .planning/STATE.md
cat .planning/ROADMAP.md
```

Find the 2-3 most recent SUMMARY.md files:
```bash
node -e "const fs=require('fs'),path=require('path');function find(d){let r=[];try{for(const e of fs.readdirSync(d,{withFileTypes:true})){const f=path.join(d,e.name);r=r.concat(e.isDirectory()?find(f):e.name.endsWith('-SUMMARY.md')?[f]:[]);}}catch(e){}return r;}const files=find('.planning').map(f=>({f,t:fs.statSync(f).mtimeMs})).sort((a,b)=>b.t-a.t).slice(0,3).map(x=>x.f);files.forEach(f=>console.log(f));"
```

Read each to extract what was recently accomplished (one-liner per plan).

## Step 3: Analyze Phase Status

For the current phase directory, count:
```bash
ls ".planning/phases/[current_phase_dir]/"*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
ls ".planning/phases/[current_phase_dir]/"*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
ls ".planning/phases/[current_phase_dir]/"*-UAT.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

Check for UAT files with gaps (issues found during testing):
```bash
grep -l "status: diagnosed" .planning/phases/[current_phase_dir]/*-UAT.md 2>/dev/null
```

Check for a `.continue-here.md` handoff file:
```bash
find .planning/phases -name ".continue-here.md" 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 4: Report Status

Calculate overall progress: count completed phases / total phases.

Display:
```
# [Project Name]

**Progress:** [████████░░] [X]% — Phase [N] of [total]

## Recent Work
- [Phase, Plan]: [what was accomplished — 1 line]
- [Phase, Plan]: [what was accomplished — 1 line]

## Current Position
Phase [N] of [total]: [phase-name]
Status: [planned | in-progress | complete]
Context: [✓ CONTEXT.md exists | — not yet]

## Key Decisions
- [Key decision from STATE.md]

## Blockers / Concerns
- [Any blockers from STATE.md, or "None"]
```

## Step 5: Route to Next Action

**Check conditions in order:**

1. **`.continue-here.md` exists** → mid-plan handoff found
   ```
   ⚠️  Handoff detected: .planning/phases/[phase]/.continue-here.md
   ▶ Next: resume-work
   ```

2. **UAT gaps exist (status: diagnosed)** → fix plans needed
   ```
   ⚠️  UAT Gaps Found in Phase [X]
   ▶ Next: plan-phase [X] (gap closure mode)
   ```

3. **Plans exist but summaries < plans** → unfinished execution
   ```
   ## ▶ Next Up
   **Phase [X]-[plan]: [Plan Name]** — [objective]
   ▶ Next: execute-phase [X]
   ```

4. **Plans = 0** → phase not yet planned
   - If CONTEXT.md exists: `▶ Next: plan-phase [X]`
   - If no CONTEXT.md: `▶ Next: discuss-phase [X]` (recommended) or `plan-phase [X]`

5. **Summaries = plans AND plans > 0, UAT not done** → verify first
   - `▶ Next: verify-work [X]`

6. **Summaries = plans, UAT passed, more phases remain** → move forward
   - `▶ Next: discuss-phase [X+1]`
   - Suggest: `/review` → `/ship` → `/compound` before starting next phase

7. **All phases done** → ready to ship
   - `▶ Next: audit-milestone`

After presenting the recommended next step, ask:

```
▶ Next: [workflow-name] [args if any]

  Run it now? Type "yes" to proceed, or just keep chatting.
```

If the user responds with "yes", "go", "do it", "run it", or "proceed" — immediately invoke that workflow.

For full auto-pilot with no prompt, use `/next` instead.
