# Changelog

All notable changes to **learnship** are documented here.

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- **MAJOR** — significant new capability layers or breaking changes
- **MINOR** — new workflows, skills, or agent personas
- **PATCH** — bug fixes to existing workflows

---

## [v2.0.7] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **Marketplace auto-sync** — `publish.yml` now dynamically counts workflows, agent personas, and impeccable commands from the source repo and pushes both an updated `marketplace.json` (version + description) and a regenerated `README.md` to `learnship-marketplace`. Previously only the version field was bumped, leaving workflow/agent counts stale (was "42 workflows, 6 agents, 18 commands" → now correctly "49 workflows, 10 agents, 21 commands").
- **Immediate marketplace fix** — Pushed correct counts to `learnship-marketplace` repo (marketplace.json + README.md) without waiting for the next tag.

---

## [v2.0.6] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **`/ideate` sequencing** — Removed incorrect "Run before `/new-project`" claim. `/ideate` requires an existing project with `AGENTS.md` and `.planning/` to ground its codebase scan. Added pre-flight check (Step 1) that stops with a helpful message if no project exists, directing users to `@agentic-learning brainstorm` for pre-project ideation instead. Updated "Route to Action" (Step 8) to offer "Start a new milestone" instead of "Start a new project."
- **`/ideate` documentation** — Updated "When to use" in `docs/workflow-reference/compounding-quality.md` to clarify project requirement and point to `@agentic-learning brainstorm` as the pre-project alternative.
- **`/complete-milestone` done banner** — Added `/ideate` and `/challenge` suggestions. This is the most natural moment to suggest between-milestone workflows, and it was the only milestone lifecycle workflow that didn't route to them.

---

## [v2.0.5] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **`docs/getting-started/first-project.md`** — Complete rewrite: now covers the full `/new-project` experience including configuration questions, research decision (always user's choice), AGENTS.md structure (Soul, Principles, Platform Context explained), and the full 7-step phase loop with dedicated sections for `/review` (Step 10), `/ship` (Step 11), and `/compound` (Step 12). Shows `config.json` with 22 keys, `.planning/solutions/` directory, and milestone closure flow.
- **`docs/getting-started/five-commands.md`** — Session pattern updated to show full 7-step loop including review, ship, compound.
- **`docs/index.md`** — "Your First Project" card description updated to reference the full loop.
- **`docs/workflow-reference/compounding-quality.md`** — Removed "optional but recommended" framing; now says "recommended after every phase."
- **`docs/examples/greenfield.md`** — Expanded Session 6 with realistic `/review` findings (P1/P2/P3), `/ship` output, and `/compound` examples. Added "What's next?" section with `/ideate`, `/challenge` for post-milestone flow. Expanded key patterns to include `/review`→`/ship`→`/compound`, `/guard`.
- **`docs/examples/brownfield.md`** — Added "Safety mode for sensitive areas" section explaining `/guard` with example. Added `/guard` row to greenfield vs brownfield comparison table.
- **`docs/core-concepts/planning-artifacts.md`** — Added `guard-state.md` and ideation artifacts to the `.planning/` directory tree.
- **`learnship/workflows/new-project.md`** — Added `/challenge` and `/guard` suggestions to the done banner.
- **`learnship/workflows/new-milestone.md`** — Added `/ideate`, `/challenge`, and `/guard` suggestions to the done banner.
- **`generate_images.py`** — Added `new_project_flow` image prompt (5-step flow: Questions → Research → Requirements → Roadmap → AGENTS.md). Updated `config_schema` prompt to include `commit_mode` and `validation` keys. Updated `extended_phase_loop` title from "optional" to "7-Step Phase Loop."
- **New image: `assets/new-project-flow.png`** — Generated diagram showing the full `/new-project` initialization flow.
- **Regenerated: `assets/config-schema.png`** — Now includes all 22 config keys.
- **Regenerated: `assets/extended-phase-loop.png`** — Updated title and framing.
- **`docs/contributing.md`** — Removed entire "Generating brand images" section (internal-only tool). Removed `generate_images.py` from the repository structure tree. Added `learnship/agents/` and `learnship/skills/` to the repo structure. Fixed test count from "146+" to "313+".

---

## [v2.0.4] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **`/new-project` AGENTS.md generation** — Step 8 now explicitly lists which template sections must be copied verbatim (Soul, Principles, Platform Context, Skills, Regressions) vs which are fill-in (Title, Current Phase, Project Structure, Tech Stack). Includes a 9-point verification checklist to prevent agents from free-styling the file. Project-specific sections (Conventions, etc.) are allowed but only in the designated slot.
- **`/new-project` research decision** — Added 🔴 MANDATORY USER CHOICE gate. The agent is now explicitly forbidden from auto-deciding whether to research, even if the domain seems familiar. The user always decides.
- **`/new-milestone` research decision** — Same mandatory user choice gate and 🛑 STOP added to prevent agents from skipping the research question.

---

## [v2.0.3] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **`docs/configuration.md`** — Added missing `planning.commit_mode` key to schema and documentation section.
- **`README.md`** — Added `planning.commit_mode`, `parallelization`, `test_first` to Core Settings table. Removed duplicate `test_first` from v2.0 Settings. Updated phase loop framing from "core 4 + 3 optional" to "7-step loop".
- **`docs/index.md`** — Workflow Engine card shows full 7-step loop instead of 4-step.
- **`docs/workflow-reference/core.md`** — "core 4-step loop" comment replaced with "7-step loop".
- **`docs/core-concepts/phase-loop.md`** — Description and framing updated to 7-step loop as the standard.

---

## [v2.0.2] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- **`/new-project` config completeness** — Now asks about model profile, test-first mode, review workflow, solutions search, ship pipeline, and auto-review. Writes all 22 config keys instead of 9. Done banner shows full 7-step phase loop.
- **`/settings` menu completeness** — Fallback config includes all v2 keys. Menu expanded from 10 to 17 items covering test-first, review, solutions search, auto-review, and ship pipeline options. Save template writes full config schema.
- **`/verify-work` auto-review** — Now reads `review.auto_after_verify` from config. If true, auto-triggers `/review` after UAT passes. If false, shows recommended next steps including `/review`, `/ship`, and `/compound`.
- **`/new-milestone` config upgrade** — New Step 6b detects missing v2 config keys and offers to merge defaults for projects started before v2.
- **`/health` config check** — Expanded from 4 top-level keys to all v2 keys including nested `workflow.review`, `workflow.solutions_search`, `review.auto_after_verify`, `ship.*`, `planning.commit_mode`.
- **`AGENTS.md` template** — Phase loop updated from 4-step to full 7-step: discuss → plan → execute → verify → review → ship → compound.
- **`/new-milestone` done banner** — Shows full 7-step phase loop instead of truncated 3-step.

---

## [v2.0.1] — 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Credits & Inspiration** — Added compound-engineering, superpowers, and gstack to credits in README and docs/contributing.md. Updated get-shit-done URL to current org.

---

## [v2.0.0] — The Compounding Harness

**Released:** 2026-04-08

### Added

- **`/compound` workflow** — Capture a recently solved problem or learned pattern while context is fresh. Creates structured documentation in `.planning/solutions/` with YAML frontmatter for searchability. Full mode (parallel research, overlap detection, dedup) and lightweight mode (single pass, fewer tokens). Integrates with `@agentic-learning` for spaced review.

- **`/review` workflow** — Multi-persona code review through six lenses: correctness, testing, security, performance, maintainability, and adversarial. Produces severity-ranked (P0-P3) findings with confidence scores (0.0-1.0). Three modes: interactive (default), report-only, autofix. Conditional persona selection based on diff content.

- **`/challenge` workflow** — Product and engineering challenge gate. Asks forcing questions through two lenses to determine whether a proposal is worth building before investing in planning. Verdicts: proceed, rethink, or reduce scope. Records decisions to DECISIONS.md.

- **`/ship` workflow** — End-to-end ship pipeline: detect test runner → run tests → lint → stage → conventional commit → push → create PR with auto-description. Closes the loop from verified code to production-ready PR.

- **`/ideate` workflow** — Codebase-grounded divergent ideation. Scans for TODOs, test gaps, hotspots, and friction points. Generates 15-25 ideas across four thinking frames (user pain, inversion, assumption-breaking, leverage). Adversarial filter eliminates weak ideas, presents top 5-7 ranked survivors.

- **`/guard` workflow** — Safety mode for sensitive phases. Warns before destructive commands, locks file scope to prevent accidental changes outside the working area. Persists guard state across sessions via `.planning/guard-state.md`.

- **`/sync-docs` workflow** — Scans documentation against recent code changes to detect stale sections, outdated references, and drift. Auto-fixes simple cases (renamed references, updated paths), flags complex ones for manual review.

- **`solution-writer` agent** (inline + dispatch) — Analyzes solved problems, classifies by track (bug vs knowledge) and category, writes structured solution documents with YAML frontmatter. Performs overlap detection across five dimensions.

- **`code-reviewer` agent** (inline + dispatch) — Reviews code through persona-specific lenses. Returns structured findings with severity and confidence. Read-only — does not edit files.

- **`challenger` agent** (inline + dispatch) — Stress-tests proposals through product and engineering forcing questions. Returns verdicts with evidence-based rationale.

- **`ideation-agent`** (inline + dispatch) — Generates codebase-grounded improvement ideas through assigned thinking frames. Pushes past obvious first ideas.

- **`solution-schema.md` reference** — YAML frontmatter schema for `.planning/solutions/`, including tracks, required fields, category mapping, and templates.

- **TDD mode** — Opt-in via `"test_first": true` in config. Executors (both inline and dispatch) use red-green-refactor cycle: write failing test → verify red → write minimum code → verify green → refactor → commit.

### Changed

- **Phase loop extended** — `discuss-phase` → `plan-phase` → `execute-phase` → `verify-work` → `/review` → `/ship` → `/compound`

- **`plan-phase` Step 2b** — New step: search `.planning/solutions/` for prior art before research. Surfaces relevant past solutions to avoid reinventing known approaches.

- **`debug` Step 9** — Now suggests `/compound` after resolving a fix to capture the problem, root cause, and solution while context is fresh.

- **`verify-work` Step 6** — Suggests `/compound` after successful UAT to capture notable patterns from the phase.

- **`knowledge-base` Step 2** — Now reads `.planning/solutions/` as an additional source. Step 3 extracts knowledge items from compounded solutions (bug track → lesson, knowledge track → pattern/anti-pattern).

- **`milestone-retrospective` Step 2b** — New quantitative summary section with metrics: phases completed, total commits, LOC changed, test file ratio, debug sessions, duration.

- **`execute-phase` Step 2c** — TDD mode check and banner when `test_first` is `true`.

- **AGENTS.md template** — Platform Context updated with solutions store reference and extended phase loop. Skills section includes Solutions Store with `/compound` and `/plan-phase` search integration.

- **`planning-config.md`** — Added v2.0.0 configuration options documentation: `test_first`, `workflow.review`, `workflow.solutions_search`, `review.auto_after_verify`, `ship.auto_test`, `ship.conventional_commits`, `ship.pr_template`.

- **`model-profiles.md`** — Added 4 new agent rows: solution-writer (sonnet/sonnet/haiku), code-reviewer (opus/sonnet/sonnet), challenger (opus/sonnet/sonnet), ideation-agent (opus/sonnet/haiku).

- **`help.md`** — Added "Compounding & Quality" section with all 7 new workflows. Updated workflow count to 49.

- **`gen-commands.js`** — Added 7 new workflow entries to WORKFLOWS array. Updated comment to 49 workflows.

- **`bin/install.js` CODEX_AGENT_SANDBOX** — Added 4 new agents: solution-writer (workspace-write), code-reviewer (read-only), challenger (read-only), ideation-agent (read-only).

### Tests

- **`validate_workflows.sh`** — Minimum workflow count raised from 32 to 39. Added 7 required workflows: compound, review, challenge, ship, ideate, guard, sync-docs.
- **`validate_multiplatform.sh`** — Expected command wrapper count raised from 42 to 49. Expected workflow file count raised from 42 to 49. Required agents list expanded to include 4 new dispatch agents. Inline persona check expanded to 9 personas.

## [v1.9.24] — Docs, images, and repo URL corrections

**Released:** 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **Upstream repo URL corrected: `agentic-learn` → `agentic-learning`** — All references to `FavioVazquez/agentic-learn` updated to the correct `FavioVazquez/agentic-learning` across `sync-upstream-skills.md` (both copies), `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/contributing.md`, `docs/skills/agentic-learning.md`, `docs/workflow-reference/maintenance.md`, and `tests/validate_multiplatform.sh`.

- **Claude Code skills path in sync workflow** — `sync-upstream-skills.md` Step 8 and Step 10 summary referenced the old `~/.claude/plugins/learnship/` path; corrected to `~/.claude/skills/`.

- **`docs/index.md` platform badge** — Badge read `platforms-5`; corrected to `platforms-6` (Windsurf, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI).

- **`docs/skills/agentic-learning.md` platform table** — Claude Code was grouped with "context file" platforms; now has its own row reflecting native skill installation at `~/.claude/skills/` with `/agentic-learning [action]` invocation.

- **`docs/platform-guide/claude-code.md`** — Updated Skills section to reflect native `~/.claude/skills/` installation and `/agentic-learning` slash command syntax.

### Updated

- **6 brand images regenerated** — Stale images updated to reflect Claude Code native skill support and corrected details:
  - `install.png` — version `v1.9.0` → `v1.9.23`
  - `skills-overview.png` — 2-column → 3-column layout separating Claude Code (native `/slash`) from Windsurf (native `@invoke`) and context-file platforms
  - `platform-comparison.png` — Claude Code Skills cell: `context file` → `native skill`
  - `agentic-learning-actions.png` — title and rows use platform-neutral `agentic-learning` instead of Windsurf-specific `@agentic-learning`
  - `impeccable-commands.png` — footer updated: Claude Code now listed alongside Windsurf as native skill platform
  - `how-it-works.png` — Design System column: `18 steering commands` → `21 steering commands`

- **`generate_images.py` prompts** — Updated all 6 stale prompts to match the above corrections. Python environment setup added (`requirements.txt`, `.venv/`) with both gitignored.

## [v1.9.23] — Fix skills not installed to ~/.claude/skills/ for Claude Code

**Released:** 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **`agentic-learning` and `impeccable` not available as native Claude Code skills** — The installer (`installClaudePlugins`) was writing skills to `~/.claude/plugins/learnship/skills/`, which is not a location Claude Code reads for user skills. Claude Code only discovers user skills from `~/.claude/skills/<skillname>/SKILL.md`. Skills were on disk but invisible to Claude Code's skill system.

  **Fix:** Renamed `installClaudePlugins` → `installClaudeSkills` and changed the target from `plugins/learnship/skills/` to `skills/` (i.e. `~/.claude/skills/<skillname>/`). Both `agentic-learning` and `impeccable` now install correctly and appear immediately in Claude Code's available skill list.

- **`@mention` invocation hints in skill descriptions** — The `description` field in `agentic-learning/SKILL.md` ended with "Invoke with @agentic-learning followed by one of: ..." and the generated `impeccable/SKILL.md` description said "Invoke with @impeccable followed by one of: ...". `@mention` is Windsurf-native syntax and does nothing in Claude Code. Claude Code discovers skills by matching the description against user intent — the `@mention` line was noise and could confuse the matcher.

  **Fix:** The `@mention` invocation hint is stripped from `agentic-learning`'s description during Claude Code install. The generated `impeccable` description now ends with "Actions: adapt, animate, ..." instead of "Invoke with @impeccable followed by one of: ...".

- **Legacy `plugins/learnship/` directory not cleaned up on reinstall** — Old installs left `~/.claude/plugins/learnship/` in place (it was never read by Claude Code). The new installer removes it during install and uninstall for backward compatibility.

- **AGENTS.md skills block updated for Claude Code** — The `<!-- LEARNSHIP_SKILLS_BLOCK -->` block generated by `rewriteAgentsMd()` for Claude Code now correctly states that skills are natively available at `~/.claude/skills/` and can be invoked via the Skill tool, while keeping the fallback instruction to read from `learnship/skills/`.

- **Uninstall now removes `skills/agentic-learning/` and `skills/impeccable/`** as well as the legacy `plugins/learnship/` directory if present.

## [v1.9.22] — Windows/PowerShell compatibility: replace python3 and bash-only commands

**Released:** 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- **`python3` removed from all workflows** — Every `python3 -c "import os; ..."` file-existence check replaced with `node -e "require('fs').existsSync(...)"` — Node.js is a guaranteed dependency on all platforms; `python3` is not present on Windows by default. Affected: `health`, `new-project`, `quick`, `resume-work`, `progress`, `next`, `ls`, `settings`, `set-profile`, `validate-phase`, `research-phase`, `remove-phase`, `insert-phase`, `add-phase`, `discuss-milestone`, `plan-milestone-gaps`, `references/planning-config.md` (~32 occurrences).
- **`mkdir -p` removed from all workflows** — Replaced with `node -e "require('fs').mkdirSync('...', {recursive:true})"` — `mkdir -p` is not available in PowerShell. Affected: `add-todo`, `debug`, `complete-milestone`, `discuss-phase`, `plan-phase`, `insert-phase`, `map-codebase`, `cleanup`, `plan-milestone-gaps`, `sync-upstream-skills`, `update` (13 occurrences).
- **`xargs ls -t | head -N` removed** — Replaced with `node -e` sort-by-mtime equivalent — `xargs` is not available in PowerShell. Affected: `ls`, `progress`, `pause-work`, `transition` (4 occurrences).
- **`head -N` / `tail -N`** — Inline PowerShell comments added: `# PowerShell: ... | Select-Object -First N / -Last N`. Affected: 25+ occurrences across 15 workflows.
- **`sort -V`** — PowerShell equivalents added as inline comments (`Sort-Object Name`). Affected: `add-phase`, `new-milestone`, `discuss-milestone`, `milestone-retrospective`, `complete-milestone`, `plan-milestone-gaps`.
- **`2>/dev/null`** — Inline `# PS: 2>$null` comments added where relevant.
- **`python3` in `release.md`** — JSON escaping for GitHub API now uses `node -e` instead of `python3`.
- **`grep -rl | head`** — PowerShell `Select-String` equivalents added as inline comments in `discovery-phase`, `audit-milestone`, `agents/debugger`.
- **`npm test 2>&1 | tail -5`** — PowerShell equivalent added as inline comment in `agents/verifier`.

### Changed

- All `learnship/workflows/` mirror copies synced with `.windsurf/workflows/` changes.
- `learnship/agents/` mirror copies synced with `agents/` changes.
- `references/planning-config.md` and its mirror updated.

## [v1.9.21] — Fix new-project ceremony: research skipped, AGENTS.md skipped, wrong next step

**Released:** 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- **Research step (Step 5) bypassed after PROJECT.md approval** — The AI treated Step 4 → Step 5 as a narrative flow-through rather than a mandatory gate. It would write REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md immediately after PROJECT.md was confirmed, skipping the research question entirely. Root cause: no hard STOP gate existed *between* steps, only *within* them.

- **AGENTS.md (Step 8) skipped after roadmap approval** — The roadmap approval in Step 7 created a natural "ceremony complete" feeling. With `commit_mode: auto`, the git commit further reinforced this. The AI would display the Step 9 done banner and suggest next steps without ever running Step 8. The `🔴 MANDATORY` notice existed but had nothing to anchor it structurally between Step 7 and Step 9.

- **Step 9 recommended `/plan-phase` instead of `/discuss-phase`** — The closing message was paraphrased as "Ready to start Phase 1? Run /plan-phase or /execute-phase" — dropping `discuss-phase` entirely. `discuss-phase` is mandatory before `plan-phase` as it writes `CONTEXT.md` that planning depends on.

  **Fixes:**
  - `new-project.md`: Added **9-step mandatory checklist** at the top of the workflow — the AI must check off each step before proceeding. Prevents silent skipping.
  - `new-project.md` after Step 4 commit: Added hard `🛑 STOP — Step 4 complete. You MUST now ask the research question (Step 5) before writing any other file.`
  - `new-project.md` Step 5: Rewrote the research question to be direct — "Before I write the requirements — do you want me to research the domain ecosystem first?" with explicit gate: "Do not write REQUIREMENTS.md yet."
  - `new-project.md` after Step 7 commit: Added hard `🛑 STOP — Step 7 complete. You MUST now generate AGENTS.md (Step 8) before anything else. Do not display the done banner.`
  - `new-project.md` Step 9: Locked next step to `▶ Next: /discuss-phase 1 — start here, not /plan-phase` with explicit explanation of the phase loop.
  - `.windsurf/workflows/new-project.md`: Regenerated from source with all fixes applied.
  - `tests/validate_multiplatform.sh`: Updated Step 4→5 gate test pattern; added 3 new tests (Step 7→8 gate, discuss-phase next, mandatory checklist).

## [v1.9.20] — Fix ceremony bypass when user sends task without running /new-project first

**Released:** 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **Cascade solves tasks directly when user never ran `/new-project`** — The ceremony bypass reported in v1.9.19 had a deeper root cause that the previous fix didn't address. The user's friend opened Windsurf on an existing codebase and typed a bug fix request directly — never invoking `/new-project` at all. Since `AGENTS.md` doesn't exist yet (it's created by `/new-project`), the routing protocol in `AGENTS.md` never loaded. Cascade saw a codebase, a task, and no learnship gate — and solved the bug directly.

  **Root cause:** `SKILL.md` (the global Windsurf skill loaded in every session) only *suggested* `/new-project` when relevant — it had no hard gate blocking task implementation when `.planning/PROJECT.md` didn't exist. The routing protocol only lived in `AGENTS.md`, which requires `/new-project` to have already run.

  **Fixes:**
  - `SKILL.md`: Added **"Mandatory Gate — No Project, No Work"** section. Before responding to any message, check if `.planning/PROJECT.md` exists. If not: block the task, tell the user to run `/new-project` first, and stop. Explicitly: "Do not offer to help with the task. Do not say 'but I can also just fix it directly.'"
  - `.windsurf/workflows/new-project.md`: Regenerated from source — was missing all three v1.9.19 fixes (routing protocol suspension notice, `HAS_CODE` codebase detection, Step 1b codebase scan, Exchange 1 detailed-answer warning). The Windsurf pre-generated copy had never been updated after v1.9.19 merged.

---

## [v1.9.19] — Fix new-project ceremony bypass on existing codebases

**Released:** 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **`/new-project` ceremony bypassed when user gives a detailed answer to "What do you want to build?"** — Three compounding bugs caused the full questioning → requirements → roadmap ceremony to be skipped:

  1. **Routing protocol intercepted Exchange 1 answers.** The `AGENTS.md` routing protocol fires on every user message. When the user pastes a detailed prompt in answer to "What do you want to build?", the AI pattern-matched it as a task/feature request and either re-routed to a workflow or started implementing directly — bypassing all subsequent exchanges.

  2. **Detailed ANSWER_1 was treated as sufficient to skip Exchanges 2–4.** The Exchange 1 `🛑 STOP` gate only said "wait for the answer" — it didn't explicitly forbid treating a thorough answer as a full replacement for the three follow-up exchanges. AI models infer: detailed answer → enough context → proceed to Step 4.

  3. **No existing codebase detection.** With real code already in the directory, the AI had visible context from IDE/tool reads and felt the ceremony was redundant — skipping straight to implementation.

  **Fixes:**
  - `learnship/workflows/new-project.md` Step 1: Added explicit **"Routing protocol suspended"** notice — every user message during `/new-project` is a workflow answer, not a routable task.
  - `learnship/workflows/new-project.md` Step 1: Added **existing codebase detection** (`HAS_CODE` check). If files exist, sets `EXISTING_CODEBASE = true` with an explicit guard: "Do NOT use existing code as an excuse to skip or shorten the questioning ceremony."
  - `learnship/workflows/new-project.md` Step 1b: New **codebase scan step** — runs `find` to map structure, used only to sharpen follow-up questions, never to infer intent.
  - `learnship/workflows/new-project.md` Exchange 1: Added `⚠️` warning: "A detailed answer to Exchange 1 does NOT satisfy Exchanges 2–4. No matter how thorough — it is raw material for follow-ups, not a replacement for them."
  - `learnship/templates/agents.md` routing protocol: Added **Step 0** — explicit check: "If `/new-project` is currently in progress, the user's message is an answer to a workflow question. Do NOT apply the routing protocol."
  - `learnship/templates/agents.md` examples: Added counter-example: "`/new-project` asked 'What do you want to build?' and user replies with a detailed description → ❌ Don't treat as a task to route → ✅ It is ANSWER_1. Record it and ask Exchange 2."

## [v1.9.18] — Fix @agentic-learning and @impeccable not working on non-Windsurf platforms

**Released:** 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **`@agentic-learning` and `@impeccable` fail on all non-Windsurf platforms** — `@mention` skill dispatch is a Windsurf-native mechanism. On Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Codex, and Cursor, typing `@agentic-learning either-or` does nothing — the AI gets no context and either errors with "isn't installed" or silently ignores the invocation. The skills ARE installed on disk but the AI has no mechanism to auto-load them from an `@mention`.

  **Root cause:** The `AGENTS.md` template had a `## Skills` section that contained only project-level notes (CHANGELOG discipline, Decisions Register) but no instructions about where skill files live or what to do with `@skill-name` syntax on non-Windsurf platforms.

  **Fix:** Added a `<!-- LEARNSHIP_SKILLS_BLOCK -->` marker to `learnship/templates/agents.md`, replaced at install time by `rewriteAgentsMd()` with platform-specific instructions:
  - **Windsurf:** "Windsurf loads `@agentic-learning` natively — invoke as normal."
  - **Claude Code / Gemini / OpenCode / Codex:** "There is no native @mention dispatch. When `@agentic-learning <action>` is mentioned, read `[path]/skills/agentic-learning/SKILL.md`, find the action section, and execute those instructions directly. Do NOT say it isn't installed."
  - **Cursor:** Added the same explicit instructions to `cursor-rules/learnship.mdc` (Cursor doesn't go through `install.js`).

  Every new project's `AGENTS.md` (generated from the template during `/new-project`) now contains the correct skill invocation instructions for the platform it was installed on. The AI reads `AGENTS.md` at the start of every session, so the instructions are always present.

## [v1.9.17] — Fix parallelization question missing on all platforms

**Released:** 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Parallelization question never shown during `/new-project`** — The `<!-- LEARNSHIP_PARALLEL_BLOCK -->` marker in `new-project.md` was correctly replaced by `rewriteNewProject()` for Claude, OpenCode, Gemini, and Codex (all go through `copyDir`). But the Windsurf workflow copy loop used `fs.copyFileSync` — a raw file copy that bypasses all rewriting. The result: every platform installed with the raw HTML comment left in place, the AI ignored it, and `parallelization` silently defaulted to `false` for all platforms. Fixed by switching the Windsurf loop to read → `replacePaths` → `rewriteNewProject` → write, matching what `copyDir` does for every other platform.

---

## [v1.9.16] — Fix stale Claude Code content + remove dead agent files

**Released:** 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Claude Code shows "Windsurf-native" text after reinstall** — Pre-1.9.0 installs created `~/.claude/workflows/` (flat). Since 1.9.0, workflows live at `~/.claude/learnship/workflows/`. The old directory was never removed, so Claude Code commands referenced the stale file via `@~/.claude/learnship/workflows/ls.md` but the pre-1.9.0 `~/.claude/workflows/ls.md` was still there and being read first. Added explicit cleanup: `install.js` now removes `~/.claude/workflows/` on every Claude install if it exists.

- **`@./agents/` broken on Claude Code, Gemini, OpenCode, Codex** — Every ceremony workflow (`plan-phase`, `execute-phase`, `verify-work`, `debug`, `quick`, etc.) uses `@./agents/researcher.md` etc. as inline personas. `@./` resolves relative to the workflow file's directory (`learnship/workflows/`). Agents were installed at `learnship/agents/` — one level up, so `@./agents/` resolved to `learnship/workflows/agents/` which didn't exist. Fixed: `install.js` now copies `learnship/agents/` into `learnship/workflows/agents/` for all non-Windsurf platforms immediately after the main `learnship/` payload install. (Windsurf was already correct — it copies agents into `.windsurf/workflows/agents/`.)

- **Dead short-name agent files in `agents/` cluttering the install** — Five files (`agents/debugger.md`, `executor.md`, `planner.md`, `researcher.md`, `verifier.md`) existed in the repo root `agents/` directory with no YAML frontmatter. `installAgents()` only copies `learnship-*.md` prefixed files, so these were never installed to any platform. They caused confusion in Claude Code's file browser (appearing alongside the real `learnship-*.md` subagent dispatch files). Removed all five.

- **`test -f FILE` fails on Windows/PowerShell** — 18 workflows used POSIX `test -f`/`test -d` shell commands for file existence checks. On Windows (Windsurf on Windows, Cursor on Windows), the agent has no bash available and PowerShell doesn't recognize `test`. Replaced all simple existence checks with `python3 -c "import os; print(...)"` one-liners which work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Complex bash blocks that use shell variables or loops (`health.md` internals, `update.md`, `sync-upstream-skills.md`) were left unchanged since they are Windsurf/bash-native internal tools.

### How the two `agents/` paths work (for reference)

| Path | Files | Purpose | Installed to |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `agents/learnship-*.md` | `learnship-debugger.md`, `learnship-executor.md`, etc. | Subagent dispatch — YAML frontmatter, used when `parallelization: true` | `~/.claude/agents/learnship-*.md` |
| `learnship/agents/` | `debugger.md`, `executor.md`, etc. | Inline personas — loaded via `@./agents/X.md` in sequential ceremony mode | `~/.claude/learnship/agents/` (Claude), `.windsurf/workflows/agents/` (Windsurf) |

These are different things at different paths. No duplication.

## [v1.9.15] — Add inline agent personas — fix broken @./agents/ references in all ceremony workflows

**Released:** 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`learnship/agents/` directory with 5 inline persona files** — `researcher.md`, `planner.md`, `executor.md`, `verifier.md`, `debugger.md`. These are the sequential-mode personas that ceremony workflows invoke on non-subagent platforms (Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Cursor) via `@./agents/`. Previously this directory did not exist, causing all `@./agents/` references to silently fail.

### Fixed

- **`@./agents/` references silently failing on Windsurf** — `install.js` copied `templates/` and `references/` subdirs into `.windsurf/workflows/` so those `@./` references resolved, but `agents/` was not copied. Added `'agents'` to the Windsurf subdir copy loop — `learnship/agents/` now installs to `.windsurf/workflows/agents/` alongside templates and references.
- **Filename mismatch** — Ceremony workflows referenced `@./agents/researcher.md`, `@./agents/planner.md`, etc. The subagent-dispatch files live at `agents/learnship-phase-researcher.md` etc. (different names, different purpose). The new `learnship/agents/` files use the exact names the workflows reference.
- **`quick.md` Step 2 blocked on `ROADMAP.md` instead of `PROJECT.md`** — The `AGENTS.md` routing protocol routes small tasks to `/quick`, but `/quick` stopped if `ROADMAP.md` was missing. Fixed: check for `PROJECT.md` (the real project existence marker). If `PROJECT.md` exists but `ROADMAP.md` is absent, continue with a note in SUMMARY.md.

### Affected ceremonies (all now have working inline personas on all platforms)

- `plan-phase` — researcher + planner + verifier personas
- `execute-phase` — executor + verifier personas
- `execute-plan` — executor persona
- `verify-work` — debugger + planner + verifier personas
- `debug` — debugger + executor personas
- `quick` — planner + verifier + executor personas
- `audit-milestone` — verifier persona
- `research-phase` — researcher persona
- `map-codebase` — researcher persona
- `new-project` — planner persona
- `new-milestone` — researcher + planner personas
- `diagnose-issues` — debugger persona

### Tests added (7 new, 246 total)

- `learnship/agents/ directory exists`
- `learnship/agents/researcher.md exists`
- `learnship/agents/planner.md exists`
- `learnship/agents/executor.md exists`
- `learnship/agents/verifier.md exists`
- `learnship/agents/debugger.md exists`
- `install.js Windsurf block copies agents/ subdir`

## [v1.9.14] — Add Request Routing Protocol to AGENTS.md — prevent ceremony bypass on existing projects

**Released:** 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **AI bypasses learnship ceremony on existing projects when user gives a specific prompt** — On an existing project (`.planning/PROJECT.md` exists), if a user typed a detailed task description, the AI would treat it as a direct coding request and implement the change immediately, skipping `/quick`, `discuss-phase`, `plan-phase`, and all planning ceremony. Root cause: `AGENTS.md` described learnship but had no intercept rule preventing direct execution.
  - **Fix:** Added **Request Routing Protocol** section to `learnship/templates/agents.md` — a mandatory decision tree that fires before the AI responds to ANY user message:
    1. Check if `.planning/PROJECT.md` exists — if not, stop and redirect to `/new-project`
    2. Classify the message — task/bug/feature → route; pure question/discussion → answer normally
    3. Size-based routing — small tasks → propose `/quick` + wait for yes; medium/uncertain → propose `discuss-phase` + wait; large/cross-cutting → run `/ls` first, then recommend
    4. **Never self-route silently** — always name the workflow and reason, then wait for explicit confirmation before invoking
  - Examples of prohibited behavior now documented inline: fixing a bug directly, starting dark mode from a prompt, treating a pasted spec as an execution command
- **4 new tests** in `tests/validate_multiplatform.sh`:
  - `AGENTS.md template has Request Routing Protocol section`
  - `AGENTS.md routing protocol forbids direct code changes`
  - `AGENTS.md routing protocol requires explicit user confirmation before invoking workflow`
  - `AGENTS.md routing protocol has decision tree with quick/discuss-phase routes`

---

## [v1.9.13] — Structurally enforce new-project questioning ceremony (take 2)

**Released:** 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **`new-project` still skipping ceremony after v1.9.12** — The `⚠ MANDATORY MINIMUM` advisory warning was insufficient; LLMs rationalize past advisory text when a user's first reply is specific. Root cause was structural: the questioning loop had no hard sequential checkpoints, only a soft "when you have enough" heuristic.
  - **Step 3 complete rewrite:** Replaced the open-ended questioning loop with 4 mandatory numbered exchanges (`Exchange 1` through `Exchange 4`), each followed by a `🛑 STOP. Wait for the user's answer.` and a named answer register (`ANSWER_1`…`ANSWER_4`). The AI cannot reach Step 4 without having explicitly received and recorded all four answers. Gate check added: verifies all four `ANSWER_N` are recorded before offering to write `PROJECT.md`.
  - **Step 4 confirmation gate hardened:** Wording changed to exactly match what a `grep` test can verify — `"Reply **yes** to continue"` — and a second `🛑 STOP` added explicitly blocking progression to Step 5 until the research question is asked and answered.
  - **Steps 5, 6, 7 STOP gates:** Upgraded from `⚠` advisory text to the `🛑 STOP.` pattern used in the rest of the workflow for consistency.
- **Tests added** (5 new checks in `tests/validate_multiplatform.sh`):
  - `new-project has 4 numbered question exchanges` — verifies Exchange 1–4 exist
  - `new-project tracks ANSWER_1..ANSWER_4` — verifies named answer registers
  - `new-project Step 4 has explicit user-confirmation gate` — verifies `Do not proceed to Step 5` + `Reply yes to continue`
  - `new-project has STOP gate between PROJECT.md confirmation and research decision`
  - `.windsurf/workflows/new-project.md has structural gates (mirror in sync)`
- Synced fix to both `learnship/workflows/new-project.md` and `.windsurf/workflows/new-project.md`.

---

## [v1.9.12] — Fix new-project skipping full ceremony on detailed first answer

**Released:** 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **`new-project` collapses ceremony when user gives a detailed first answer** — Step 3 lacked a hard minimum: if the user's first reply was specific and detailed, the AI would self-conclude it had "enough context", skip to PROJECT.md, then silently collapse the remaining steps (research decision, requirements gathering, roadmap) into a direct code change. Root cause: no required minimum of follow-up questions before the AI could proceed.
  - **Step 3 fix:** Added explicit `⚠ MANDATORY MINIMUM` gate: AI must ask **at least 3 follow-up questions** after the user's first answer before being allowed to propose writing PROJECT.md. No exceptions regardless of how detailed the initial response is.
  - **Step 4 fix:** Added mandatory `⚠ STOP` after writing PROJECT.md: AI must show the full file to the user and receive explicit confirmation before proceeding to the research decision. A brief "ok" or silence does not count as confirmation.
- Synced fix to both `learnship/workflows/new-project.md` and `.windsurf/workflows/new-project.md`.

## [v1.9.11] — Sync 3 new impeccable skills from upstream (arrange, typeset, overdrive)

**Released:** 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`@impeccable arrange`** — New skill: fix layout, spacing, and visual rhythm. Tackles monotonous grids, inconsistent spacing, and weak visual hierarchy. Includes squint test, spacing system guidance, Flexbox-vs-Grid decision framework, card grid anti-patterns.
- **`@impeccable typeset`** — New skill: fix font choices, hierarchy, sizing, weight consistency, and readability. Turns default-looking Inter/Roboto text into intentional, well-crafted type. Includes fluid-vs-fixed scale guidance, web font loading, OpenType details.
- **`@impeccable overdrive`** — New skill: push interfaces past conventional limits with technically ambitious implementations — shaders, 60fps virtual tables via virtual scrolling, spring physics on dialogs, scroll-driven animations, WebGPU. Proposes 2-3 directions before building; requires user confirmation.
- **`frontend-design` Context Gathering Protocol** — Added the upstream "Context Gathering Protocol" section to `frontend-design/SKILL.md`, making the 3-step context-gathering order (instructions → `.impeccable.md` → teach-impeccable) explicit for all design skills.

### Fixed

- **Broken `reference/` links in `arrange` and `typeset`** — Both skills referenced `reference/spatial-design.md` and `reference/typography.md` from their own directory (which doesn't exist). Fixed to `../frontend-design/reference/spatial-design.md` and `../frontend-design/reference/typography.md`.
- **`typography.md` fluid type guidance** — Updated to upstream's more precise version: distinguishes "use fluid type for marketing headings" vs "use fixed rem scales for app UIs" (no major app design system uses fluid type in product UI).

### Changed

- **Root `impeccable/SKILL.md`** — Updated action count 18→21, added `arrange`, `typeset`, `overdrive` to the Actions list.
- **`install.js` `SUB_ACTION_ORDER`** — Added `arrange`, `overdrive`, `typeset` so Claude Code plugin inlines all 21 sub-skill bodies correctly.
- **`audit/SKILL.md`** — Suggested command lists updated to include `/arrange`, `/typeset`, `/overdrive`.
- **`sync-upstream-skills` workflow** — Updated 18→21 throughout (expected list, banner text, integrity check).
- **`cursor-rules/learnship.mdc`** — Added `@impeccable arrange`, `@impeccable typeset`, `@impeccable overdrive` to the Design Quality section.
- **Tests** — Section 10/11 updated: `SUB_SKILLS` array has all 21, body-content checks assert `arrange`/`overdrive`/`typeset` inline content, size threshold raised to 60 000 chars.
- **README, docs** — All "18 commands"/"17 commands" references updated to 21 throughout (`docs/skills/impeccable.md`, `docs/getting-started/installation.md`, `docs/index.md`, `docs/platform-guide/*.md`).
- **Images** — `assets/impeccable-commands.png` regenerated with 21-command grid; `assets/skills-overview.png` regenerated showing `[21 sub-skills]` (was `[17 sub-skills]`). `generate_images.py` prompts updated to match.

---

## [v1.9.10] — Fix `@impeccable` not found in Claude Code

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **`@impeccable critique` (and all other actions) returned "isn't installed as a skill"** — `installClaudePlugins` was writing a hollow 100-line index `SKILL.md` that listed sub-skills as markdown reference links (`[critique/SKILL.md](references/critique/SKILL.md)`). Claude Code does not follow those links when resolving `@mentions`, so the skill loaded with no actionable content. Fix: `installClaudePlugins` now builds a single **inlined** `SKILL.md` (~3000 lines) that concatenates all 18 sub-skill bodies under `## Action: \`<name>\`` headers — identical in approach to `agentic-learning` which already worked correctly.
- **`installClaudePlugins` exported for testing** — added to `LEARNSHIP_TEST_MODE` exports so section 10 tests can use the real function instead of a duplicated local simulation.
- **Section 10 tests updated** — replaced the stale local `runInstallClaudePlugins` clone with the real exported function; tests 7/8/9 now verify inlined content, real bodies, and clean frontmatter instead of the old reference-link approach.

### Platform impact

| Platform | Skill delivery | Change |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `plugins/learnship/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md` — fully inlined | ✅ Fixed |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurf/skills/impeccable/` — native sub-skill dirs | No change |
| **Cursor** | `skills/impeccable/` via `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` + `.mdc` rule | No change |
| **OpenCode / Gemini / Codex** | `learnship/skills/impeccable/` via plain `copyDir` | No change |

## [v1.9.9] — Correct parallelization platform matrix (Gemini CLI sequential-only; Cursor 2.4+ parallel)

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **Gemini CLI incorrectly offered the parallelization question** — Gemini CLI has subagents but parallel execution is not yet shipped (open GitHub issues #14963, #17749). `rewriteNewProject` now treats Gemini the same as Windsurf for Group D: auto-sets `parallelization: false` and explains why.
- **Cursor docs said "Parallel subagents: ❌ Not supported"** — Cursor 2.4 (released Oct 2025) introduced native parallel subagents. Updated `docs/platform-guide/cursor.md` capabilities table.
- **2 new tests added** for OpenCode and Codex parallel block; Gemini test corrected to assert question is absent.

### Verified parallel subagent support (from official docs):

| Platform | Parallel subagents |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | ✅ Yes — `Task()` tool |
| OpenCode | ✅ Yes |
| Codex CLI | ✅ Yes — explicit spawning, `max_concurrency` |
| Cursor | ✅ Yes — since 2.4 (Oct 2025), via `.cursor/rules/` workflows |
| Gemini CLI | ⚠️ Sequential only — parallel is an open issue, not shipped |
| Windsurf | ❌ No subagents |

---

## [v1.9.8] — Fix platform-specific gitignore and parallelization question via install-time rewriting

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **`.windsurf/` was added to `.gitignore` on Claude Code installs** — the gitignore bash block was a multi-line commented snippet; agents ran the first uncommented line (`.claude/`) on Claude Code, but the Windsurf-installed workflow kept `.windsurf/` commented out. Now `install.js` rewrites the gitignore command at install time to a single exact line per platform (e.g. `grep -q '.claude/' .gitignore || echo '.claude/' >> .gitignore` for Claude Code, `.windsurf/` for Windsurf, etc.). No conditional prose for the agent to misinterpret.
- **Parallelization question not asked on Claude Code** — the `If PLATFORM is WINDSURF skip / else ask` conditional prose was too ambiguous for agents. `install.js` now rewrites Group D at install time: non-Windsurf platforms get the question unconditionally; Windsurf gets a note saying parallelization is automatically `false`.
- **Platform label now injected at install time** — Step 1 states the exact platform name and config dir, removing any runtime detection logic entirely.
- **8 new unit tests** added for `rewriteNewProject()` covering all platforms (gitignore dir, parallel block presence/absence, no raw markers remaining).

---

## [v1.9.7] — Fix platform detection using file path table (not env vars)

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **Platform detection was unreliable on multi-platform machines** — env-var detection returned `WINDSURF` on any machine with `~/.codeium/` installed, even when running inside Claude Code. Detection now uses a simple path-segment lookup table: the agent inspects the path of the file it is reading (e.g. `.../.claude/learnship/workflows/new-project.md`) and maps the directory segment to the platform. No bash, no env vars, not affected by `replacePaths()`.

---

## [v1.9.6] — Fix all 42 Claude Code command wrappers pointing to wrong workflow path

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **All 42 Claude Code commands were silently broken** — every command wrapper in `commands/learnship/` referenced `@~/.claude/workflows/<name>.md` but the actual install path is `@~/.claude/learnship/workflows/<name>.md`. Claude Code was reading a non-existent file and falling back to its own (incomplete) knowledge for every command — `/learnship:new-project`, `/learnship:execute-phase`, `/learnship:ls`, and all others. All 42 paths corrected to `@~/.claude/learnship/workflows/`.

---

## [v1.9.5] — new-project: platform detection + correct parallelization question per platform

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **`new-project` didn't ask parallelization question on Claude Code** — Step 1 now detects the running platform (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, Windsurf) by checking which config directory contains the workflow file. Group D parallelization question is now gated with an explicit `If PLATFORM is CLAUDE/OPENCODE/GEMINI/CODEX: Ask this` / `If PLATFORM is WINDSURF: Skip, set false` structure — replacing the weak hint that agents ignored.
- **`new-project` was adding `.windsurf/` to `.gitignore` on all platforms** — now adds the correct platform-specific directory (`.claude/`, `.opencode/`, `.gemini/`, `.codex/`, or `.windsurf/`) based on detected platform.
- **Step 9 completion message** — now shows the detected platform and parallelization setting as confirmation.
- Both `learnship/workflows/new-project.md` and `.windsurf/workflows/new-project.md` updated in sync.

---

## [v1.9.4] — Fix skills not installing on Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, Codex

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **Skills install failure on all non-Windsurf platforms** — `bin/install.js` was looking for skills at `.windsurf/skills/` (a Windsurf-specific path) instead of the repo-root `skills/` directory. This caused an `ENOENT` crash during `npx learnship --claude` (and all other platforms). Skills now install correctly for all platforms.

---

## [v1.9.3] — Fix npx learnship showing Windsurf-only installer

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **`npx learnship` was Windsurf-only** — `bin/learnship.js` was calling `install.sh` (the old Windsurf-only shell script) instead of `bin/install.js` (the full multi-platform Node.js installer). Running `npx learnship` would show only a Windsurf prompt and fail with a source-path error. Now correctly delegates to `bin/install.js`, showing the full interactive platform selector (Windsurf, Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI).

---

## [v1.9.2] — Cursor plugin compliance + housekeeping

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **Cursor `plugin.json`** — added required `displayName` field; added `commands` field pointing to `commands/learnship`; fixed `logo` to reference `assets/logo.png` (PNG with background plate) instead of the SVG.
- **`hooks-cursor.json`** — replaced invalid `sessionStart` hook type (not supported by Cursor) with `beforeSubmitPrompt`; removed spurious `"version": 1` field not in Cursor spec.
- **Author email** — corrected `favio.vazquez@gmail.com` → `favio.vazquezp@gmail.com` across all plugin manifests (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).
- **Test suite** — updated hooks test to expect `beforeSubmitPrompt` instead of `sessionStart`.

### Added

- **`assets/logo.png`** — 512×512 PNG logo (dark background, `/ls` in green) for Cursor marketplace submission.
- **`PRIVACY.md`** — privacy policy for Anthropic Claude Code Verified Status; learnship collects no user data.

---

## [v1.9.1] — Fix new-project workflow skipping steps + auto npm publish

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **`new-project` workflow skipping steps 5–8** — agents were jumping from questioning directly to building, bypassing the research decision, interactive requirements selection, roadmap approval, and `AGENTS.md` generation. Added explicit `⚠ STOP` gates after Steps 4, 5, 6, and 7 instructing the agent not to proceed until the user responds at each gate.
- **`AGENTS.md` never written** — root cause was the above skip. Step 8 now carries a `🔴 MANDATORY` marker making it unambiguous that it must always be executed before Step 9, regardless of how the agent perceives the session state.

### Added

- **GitHub Action: auto npm publish** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) — triggers on any `v*` tag push. Runs the full test suite first (`tests/run_all.sh`), verifies the tag matches `package.json` version, then runs `npm publish --access public` using the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret. No more manual `npm publish` after tagging.

---

## [v1.9.0] — Multi-platform distribution: marketplaces, hooks, session context injection, npm publish

**Released:** 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Claude Code plugin manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`): learnship is now a native Claude Code plugin. Install via `/plugin marketplace add FavioVazquez/learnship-marketplace` + `/plugin install learnship@learnship-marketplace`.
- **Claude Code community marketplace** (`marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `FavioVazquez/learnship-marketplace` repo): enables community marketplace discovery in Claude Code.
- **Cursor plugin manifest** (`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`) and rules (`cursor-rules/learnship.mdc`): full Cursor plugin with skills, rules, and agents. Install via `/add-plugin learnship` in Cursor.
- **Cursor platform guide** (`docs/platform-guide/cursor.md`): dedicated documentation page for Cursor, covering install, workflows, skills, hooks, and capabilities.
- **Gemini CLI native extension** (`gemini-extension.json`): enables `gemini extensions install https://github.com/FavioVazquez/learnship` as a zero-terminal install path.
- **npm publish prep**: `publishConfig.access = "public"`, `.npmignore`, new manifests in `files`. `npx learnship` is now the canonical install command replacing the old `npx github:` form.
- **Session-start hooks** (`hooks/session-start`, `hooks/hooks-cursor.json`, `hooks/hooks-claude.json`): bash hook that injects learnship context (`SKILL.md`) at every session start for Claude Code and Cursor. Correctly emits `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` for Claude Code and `additional_context` for Cursor — no double-injection.
- **Platform-neutral `skills/` directory**: skills now live at `skills/` (not `.windsurf/skills/`) in the published package, eliminating confusing Windsurf-branded paths in Cursor and Claude Code plugin manifests. `.windsurf/skills/` retained for Windsurf native install.
- **Cursor added as 6th platform** throughout: README badge, platform table, `docs/index.md`, `mkdocs.yml` nav, all image prompts regenerated.
- **8 brand images regenerated**: `install`, `platform-comparison`, `impeccable-commands`, `skills-overview`, `how-it-works`, `phase-loop`, `vibe-vs-agentic`, `quick-start-flow` — all updated for `npx learnship`, 6 platforms, 18 impeccable commands.
- **39 new tests** (Sections 15, 19, 20): plugin manifest validation, `skills/` directory sync, hooks structure + executable bit + shebang, plugin-root paths in hook manifests, runtime execution tests for `session-start` across all three modes (Cursor, Claude Code, fallback) — validates valid JSON output, correct keys per platform, no double-injection, learnship keywords in context, graceful exit when `SKILL.md` missing.

### Fixed

- **Critical: double `learnship/learnship/` path bug** in all 42 `commands/learnship/` source files. Command files referenced `@~/.claude/learnship/workflows/` but `replacePaths()` replaces `~/.claude/` → `pathPrefix` (which is already `~/.claude/learnship/`), producing `learnship/learnship/` on every non-Windsurf platform. This silently broke every workflow command — `/new-project`, `/ls`, all 42 — on Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI. `AGENTS.md` was never generated because `/new-project` couldn't load its workflow file. Fixed by changing all source references to `@~/.claude/workflows/` (no `learnship/` prefix).
- **Hook manifest command paths**: changed from relative `./hooks/session-start` to `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/session-start"` and `"${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/session-start"` — relative paths break when plugins are installed globally.
- **`hooks-claude.json` format**: corrected to match Claude Code's actual hook schema (`description` + inner `hooks` array with `type: "command"`).

### Changed

- **`npx github:FavioVazquez/learnship` → `npx learnship`** across README and all 7 platform docs pages.
- **Plugin manifests**: `skills` field changed from `.windsurf/skills` → `skills` (platform-neutral); `hooks` field added to both Claude Code and Cursor manifests.
- **`package.json` `files`**: `.windsurf/skills` replaced with `skills` and `hooks` added.
- **Post-install message** in `bin/install.js` now explicitly tells users to run `/new-project` to generate `AGENTS.md` — it is not created by the installer.
- **Platform guides for OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI**: added `AGENTS.md` auto-loading tip (not auto-loaded on these platforms the way it is on Windsurf/Claude Code/Cursor); fixed 17 → 18 impeccable sub-skills count.
- **`impeccable` command count**: 17 → 18 throughout (`frontend-design` command added previously but count was stale in README, docs, and image prompts).
- **`docs/index.md`**: 5 → 6 platforms, Cursor badge added, 17 → 18 impeccable count.
- **`mkdocs.yml` `site_description`**: updated to include Cursor.

---

## [v1.8.0] — impeccable integration: automatic UI standards and milestone recommendations

**Released:** 2026-03-14

### Added

- **`execute-phase` UI detection (Step 2b):** Before executing any phase, learnship now scans plan objectives and file paths for UI/frontend signals (`component`, `page`, `layout`, `tailwind`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, etc.). When detected, it activates `@impeccable frontend-design` principles as active execution guidance — typography, color, layout, and component standards applied as constraints during execution, not as a post-hoc review. Displays a `UI PHASE DETECTED` banner and carries principles through every task in the phase.
- **Post-action milestone recommendation in `@impeccable`:** After any impeccable action that produces recommendations (`audit`, `critique`, `polish`, `normalize`, `harden`, `adapt`, `optimize`, `bolder`, `quieter`, `colorize`, `clarify`, `delight`, `onboard`, `animate`, `distill`, `extract`), the agent now always closes with a suggestion to run `/new-milestone` to create a dedicated "UI Polish" milestone — turning recommendations into versioned, traceable phases with plans and commits. Setup actions (`teach-impeccable`, `frontend-design`) are exempt.
- **9 new tests in `validate_multiplatform.sh`** covering both integration behaviors, sync between `.windsurf/` and `learnship/` copies, and docs/README coverage.
- **Docs updated** (`docs/skills/impeccable.md`) with a new "learnship integration" section documenting both behaviors.
- **README updated** with integration description in the Design System section.

## [v1.7.1] — Fix AGENTS.md not generated on Windsurf new-project

**Released:** 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Windsurf installer** now copies `templates/` and `references/` subdirectories into `workflows/` so `@./templates/agents.md` and `@./references/questioning.md` references resolve correctly on Windsurf. Previously, `new-project` Step 8 silently skipped writing `AGENTS.md` because the template file path was broken on Windsurf (other platforms were unaffected).
- **Tests** — added coverage for `learnship/templates/agents.md` and `learnship/references/questioning.md` existence

---

## [v1.7.0] — Full documentation site (MkDocs + GitHub Pages)

**Released:** 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Full documentation site** at `https://faviovazquez.github.io/learnship/` — built with MkDocs Material theme
- **`mkdocs.yml`** — complete site config with Material theme, custom brand CSS, tabbed content, admonitions, mermaid diagrams, search, and dark/light mode
- **`docs/`** — 26 pages covering everything:
  - Getting Started: installation, first project walkthrough, the 5 commands
  - Platform Guide: dedicated pages for all 5 platforms (Windsurf, Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI)
  - Core Concepts: phase loop, context engineering, planning artifacts, agentic vs vibe coding
  - Skills: full reference for all 11 `@agentic-learning` actions and all 17 `impeccable` commands
  - Workflow Reference: all 42 workflows organized across 7 category pages
  - Configuration: full `config.json` schema reference
  - Examples: greenfield, brownfield, quick tasks, multi-session patterns
  - Contributing guide
- **`.github/workflows/docs.yml`** — auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main` that touches `docs/` or `mkdocs.yml`
- **8 new image definitions** in `generate_images.py` (keys: `agentic_learning_actions`, `impeccable_commands`, `platform_comparison`, `planning_artifacts`, `config_schema`, `parallel_execution`, `skills_overview`, `milestone_lifecycle`) — 16 total
- **`docs/stylesheets/extra.css`** — brand CSS: hero section, card grids, platform badges, command pills, learn badges, typography
- **Test section [13]** — 10 new checks in `tests/validate_multiplatform.sh` verifying mkdocs config, all platform pages, all 11 learning actions documented, docs workflow, README link, and image count — **156 total passing**
- **README** — added docs badge + `📚 Full Docs` link + "What is learnship / What problem / Who is it for" sections with agent harness and progressive disclosure framing
- **`docs/index.md`** — full "What is learnship / What problem / Who is it for" context sections explaining learnship as an agent harness using progressive disclosure
- **`assets/logo.svg`** — `/ls` monospace wordmark (white, transparent background)
- **`assets/favicon.svg`** — crisp SVG favicon: dark rounded background + white `/ls` text, infinitely sharp at any size
- **`docs/assets`** — symlinked to `assets/` root — single source of truth, no duplication between README and docs images

### Fixed

- Docs hero badges all use `for-the-badge` style with `labelColor=555555` for visual consistency
- Platform and workflows badges now clickable with correct MkDocs URL paths
- `docs.yml` CI workflow pins `mkdocs-material<2` and resolves `docs/assets` symlink before build
- Test section [13]: replaced gitignored `generate_images.py` check with `assets/` PNG count check
- `new-project.md` — added parallelization question for non-Windsurf platforms during setup

---

## [v1.6.3] — Deep agentic-learning integration across all workflow phases

**Released:** 2026-03-14

### Changed

All 11 core workflows now surface contextually matched `@agentic-learning` actions at every phase transition — not just one tail tip, but 2-3 options matched to what just happened:

- **`execute-phase`** — Learning Checkpoint now offers `reflect` + `quiz` + `interleave`. Active recall on what was built, gaps in understanding surfaced before they become next-phase bugs.
- **`plan-phase`** — Now offers `explain-first` + `cognitive-load` + `quiz`. Validate the mental model before touching code, not after.
- **`research-phase`** — Now offers `learn` + `explain-first` + `quiz`. Three retrieval actions while new domain knowledge is at peak freshness.
- **`discuss-phase`** — Now offers `either-or` + `brainstorm` + `explain-first`. Decision journaling plus blind-spot surfacing and model validation before locking context.
- **`verify-work`** — Now has separate learning paths: pass path (`space` + `quiz`) and bug-found path (`learn` + `space`). Bugs during UAT are treated as learning opportunities, not just defects.
- **`debug`** — Replaced single `either-or` with `learn` + `struggle` + `either-or`. Bugs are the highest-signal learning moments — each now explicitly drives retrieval and re-investigation.
- **`quick`** — Removed overly narrow "technically complex" condition. Now offers `struggle` + `learn` + `either-or` for any completed task with a matching rationale.
- **`pause-work`** — **New Learning Checkpoint added.** Session transitions are when learning decays fastest. Now offers `space` + `reflect` before the session ends.
- **`resume-work`** — **New Learning Checkpoint added.** Returning after a break now offers `quiz` + `space` to warm up before diving in.
- **`new-milestone`** — Added missing `manual` branch to Learning Checkpoint.
- **`debug`** — Added missing `manual` branch to Learning Checkpoint.
- All `.windsurf/workflows/` changes synced to `learnship/workflows/`.

### Added

- **Test section [12]** — 14 new checks in `tests/validate_multiplatform.sh` verifying:
  - All 13 key workflows have a Learning Checkpoint section
  - All checkpoints read `learning_mode` and have both `auto` + `manual` branches
  - Per-workflow action coverage (reflect/quiz/interleave in execute-phase, etc.)
  - All 11 `@agentic-learning` actions (`learn`, `quiz`, `reflect`, `space`, `brainstorm`, `explain-first`, `struggle`, `either-or`, `explain`, `interleave`, `cognitive-load`) referenced somewhere in the suite
  - Source/installed copies in sync for all 9 modified workflows

---

## [v1.6.2] — Subagent dispatch for plan-phase, execute-phase, and debug

**Released:** 2026-03-14

### Changed

- **`plan-phase` workflow** — Now reads `parallelization` from `.planning/config.json`. When `true`, spawns three dedicated subagents (`learnship-phase-researcher`, `learnship-planner`, `learnship-plan-checker`) each with a fresh context budget. When `false` (default), all stages run inline using agent persona files (unchanged behavior).
- **`execute-phase` workflow** — Now reads `parallelization` from `.planning/config.json`. When `true`, dispatches each plan in a wave to a dedicated `learnship-executor` subagent; spawns all wave plans before waiting. When `false` (default), sequential persona-based execution unchanged.
- **`debug` workflow** — Now reads `parallelization` from `.planning/config.json`. When `true`, spawns a dedicated `learnship-debugger` subagent with a fresh context budget for deep root-cause investigation. When `false` (default), inline debugger persona unchanged.
- Both `.windsurf/workflows/` and `learnship/workflows/` copies updated in sync.

---

## [v1.6.1] — Platform-agnostic language sweep

**Released:** 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`/sync-upstream-skills` workflow** — New workflow that pulls the latest skill content from both upstream repos into learnship's skill tree, then re-runs the installer so all platforms receive the update:
  - `FavioVazquez/agentic-learning` → replaces `.windsurf/skills/agentic-learning/SKILL.md` + `references/` verbatim
  - `pbakaus/impeccable` → replaces each of the 18 sub-skill dirs under `.windsurf/skills/impeccable/` from `source/skills/`
  - **Preserves** `.windsurf/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md` (learnship's own dispatcher — not in upstream)
  - Backs up current skills before overwriting; auto-restores on integrity failure
  - Re-runs `node bin/install.js --all` to propagate to Claude Code plugins, Windsurf, and context-file platforms
  - Prompts to review if upstream added new actions/sub-skills that need learnship's dispatcher updated

### Changed

- **`SKILL.md`** (root) — "Windsurf-native platform" → "multi-platform agentic engineering system"; workflow list intro updated to mention all platforms.
- **`templates/agents.md`** + **`learnship/templates/agents.md`** — "Windsurf reads this file" → "Your AI agent reads this file".
- **`learnship/workflows/ls.md`** + **`.windsurf/workflows/ls.md`** — "Windsurf-native platform" → "multi-platform agentic engineering system".
- **`learnship/workflows/new-project.md`** + **`.windsurf/workflows/new-project.md`** — "Windsurf reads this every conversation" → "your AI agent reads this every conversation".
- **`learnship/workflows/execute-phase.md`** — sequential mode comment now says "Windsurf, Gemini CLI" (was "Windsurf, Gemini").
- **`agents/learnship-executor.md`** — "Windsurf/Codex projects" → "Windsurf, Codex, or any platform that uses AGENTS.md".
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — "Windsurf slash commands" → "slash commands"; "Windsurf's command palette" → "the agent's command palette"; "Windsurf-native rules" section heading → "Workflow rules"; testing instructions updated to show multi-platform install; "Windsurf-native" philosophy bullet → "Platform-native".
- **`README.md`** — repository structure comments updated: "Windsurf slash commands" → "slash commands"; skill native platform comments updated to include Claude Code; "non-Windsurf" → "OpenCode/Gemini/Codex".
- **`.windsurf/skills/agentic-learning/SKILL.md`** + **`.windsurf/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md`** — `compatibility` field updated to include Claude Code.
- **`publish-first-release.md`** — "Windsurf-native platform" → "multi-platform agentic engineering system".

---

## [v1.6.0] — Claude Code native plugin skills

**Released:** 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`bin/install.js` — `installClaudePlugins()`** — New function that installs skills as a native Claude Code plugin under `~/.claude/plugins/learnship/`. Creates exactly **2 skills**:
  - `skills/agentic-learning/` — full copy with `SKILL.md` + `references/`
  - `skills/impeccable/` — root `SKILL.md` (dispatcher) + all 18 sub-skills copied into `references/`: `adapt`, `animate`, `audit`, `bolder`, `clarify`, `colorize`, `critique`, `delight`, `distill`, `extract`, `frontend-design`, `harden`, `normalize`, `onboard`, `optimize`, `polish`, `quieter`, `teach-impeccable`
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest
- **`.windsurf/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md`** — New root skill file. Links to sub-skills using sibling paths (`adapt/SKILL.md`) which work for Windsurf. The installer rewrites these to `references/adapt/SKILL.md` when copying to the Claude Code plugin dir.
- **Uninstall** — `plugins/learnship/` is now removed on `--uninstall` for the `claude` platform.
- **Section [10] tests** — 10 new checks verifying plugin structure, manifest fields, two-skill count, path rewriting, all 18 references, no flattening, and uninstall guard. Test suite now covers **113 checks, 0 failures**.

### Notes

- The existing `learnship/skills/` context file copy is preserved for backwards compatibility.
- Windsurf reads `impeccable/SKILL.md` directly with correct sibling-relative paths.
- Claude Code gets the same content with paths rewritten to `references/` to match the installed layout.

---

## [v1.5.3] — Fix skills missing on npx install

**Released:** 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **`package.json`** — Added `.windsurf/skills` to the `files` array. It was missing, so `npx github:FavioVazquez/learnship` stripped the skills directory entirely — `fs.existsSync(skillsSrc)` returned false and skills were silently skipped for all platforms.
- **`package.json`** — Bumped version to `1.5.3` so the banner correctly displays the current version.
- **`tests/validate_multiplatform.sh`** — Added regression test in section [1]: verifies `package.json` `files` includes `.windsurf/skills`. **103 checks, 0 failures**.

---

## [v1.5.2] — Fix skills not installed for Windsurf

**Released:** 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **`bin/install.js`** — Skills (`agentic-learning`, `impeccable`) were not installed for Windsurf at all. The guard `platform !== 'windsurf'` was wrong — Windsurf needs skills copied to `targetDir/skills/` (i.e. `.windsurf/skills/`) so Cascade can invoke them natively. Other platforms still get them at `learnship/skills/` as context files.
- **`tests/validate_multiplatform.sh`** — Updated test 7 in section [9] to verify Windsurf gets skills at `skills/` (native) and others at `learnship/skills/`. **102 checks, 0 failures**.

---

## [v1.5.1] — Fix local Windsurf install path

**Released:** 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **`bin/install.js`** — Local Windsurf install (`--windsurf --local`) was writing to `.codeium/windsurf/` inside the project instead of `.windsurf/`. Cascade reads `.windsurf/workflows/` — commands were installed but never loaded. Fixed `getDirName('windsurf')` to return `.windsurf` (global install correctly uses `~/.codeium/windsurf/` via `getGlobalDir` and was unaffected).
- **`tests/validate_multiplatform.sh`** — Added regression test: local Windsurf install path must be `.windsurf/` not `.codeium/windsurf/`. Test suite now covers **102 checks, 0 failures**.

---

## [v1.5.0] — Skills on all platforms, purple ASCII banner, 101-check test suite

**Released:** 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Skills installed on all non-Windsurf platforms** — `agentic-learning` and `impeccable` are now copied to `learnship/skills/` as context files during install on Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI. The AI reads and applies the learning techniques and design standards automatically. Windsurf keeps native `@invoke` support unchanged.
- **Purple ASCII art banner** — `npx github:FavioVazquez/learnship` now displays a full ASCII art `learnship` logo in purple (distinct from GSD's cyan) with the slogan `Learn as you build. Build with intent.` and all 5 platform names.
- **Section [9] skills tests** — 7 new checks in `tests/validate_multiplatform.sh` verifying skills source structure, copy correctness, SKILL.md content, impeccable sub-skills, and the Windsurf guard. Test suite now covers **101 checks total, 0 failures**.

### Changed

- **README: platform capabilities table** — Added `Skills (native @invoke)` and `Skills (context files)` rows showing per-platform support.
- **README: Learning Partner section** — Added per-platform table explaining how `agentic-learning` works on each platform.
- **README: Design System section** — Added per-platform table explaining how `impeccable` works on each platform.
- **README: repository structure** — Accurate skill count (14 impeccable sub-skills), context files note for non-Windsurf platforms.
- **`generate_images.py`** — `install.png` and `agents-md.png` prompts updated to be platform-agnostic (purple ASCII art, all 5 platforms listed, no Windsurf-specific copy).
- **`assets/install.png`** — Regenerated: purple ASCII art banner, `~/.claude/learnship/` install path, all 5 platforms in annotation panel.
- **`assets/agents-md.png`** — Regenerated: subtitle now reads "Your AI agent reads this file automatically" (no Windsurf mention).

### Removed

- **`.windsurf/skills/frontend-design/`** — Deleted top-level duplicate. The canonical `frontend-design` skill lives at `impeccable/frontend-design/` and is already referenced by all impeccable sub-skills.

---

## [v1.4.0] — Multi-platform support: Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Multi-platform installer** — `bin/install.js` Node.js installer replacing bash-only `install.sh`. Supports `--windsurf`, `--claude`, `--opencode`, `--gemini`, `--codex`, `--all` flags with `--global`/`--local` scope.
- **`commands/learnship/`** — 42 Claude Code format command wrappers (`/learnship:ls`, `/learnship:new-project`, etc.) auto-converted to platform-specific formats at install time.
- **`learnship/`** — Payload directory with all 42 workflows, references, and templates installed to each platform's config dir.
- **`agents/learnship-executor.md`** — Spawnable plan executor for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex (atomic per-task commits, SUMMARY.md, STATE.md updates).
- **`agents/learnship-planner.md`** — Spawnable planner agent for phase plan creation.
- **`agents/learnship-phase-researcher.md`** — Spawnable research agent for pre-planning domain investigation.
- **`agents/learnship-plan-checker.md`** — Spawnable plan verifier (goal coverage, requirements, wave correctness).
- **`agents/learnship-verifier.md`** — Spawnable phase verifier (must_haves, integration links, requirement traceability).
- **`agents/learnship-debugger.md`** — Spawnable debugger with scientific method root-cause investigation.
- **Platform-enhanced workflows** — `execute-phase`, `plan-phase`, and `debug` now detect `parallelization` in config and spawn real subagents on capable platforms (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex). Sequential fallback always available.
- **`tests/validate_multiplatform.sh`** — Full multi-platform test suite: installer, command wrappers, learnship/ payload, agent files, conversion functions.
- **README Platform Support section** — Install commands and capability matrix for all 5 platforms.

### Platform command format

| Platform | Commands | Invoked as |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/workflows/` | `/ls`, `/new-project` |
| Claude Code | `commands/learnship/` | `/learnship:ls` |
| OpenCode | `command/learnship-*.md` | `/learnship-ls` |
| Gemini CLI | `commands/learnship/*.toml` | `/learnship:ls` |
| Codex CLI | `skills/learnship-*/` | `$learnship-ls` |

---

## [v1.3.0] — Simplified UX, smarter entry points, Gemini-generated image

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`/ls` workflow** — new primary entry point: shows project status + next step + offers to run it immediately; bootstraps new users to `/new-project` automatically
- **`/next` workflow** — auto-pilot: reads project state and runs the correct next workflow without user needing to remember command names
- **`assets/quick-start-flow.png`** — Gemini Imagen-generated diagram showing the 5-command entry surface with `/ls` as hub
- **`tests/validate_ux.sh`** — new test suite (24 checks) validating `/ls`, `/next`, README documentation, `help.md` Start Here block, and `SKILL.md` references

---

## [v1.2.2] — Complete parallel/agent accuracy sweep

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **`help.md`** — "Wave-based parallel execution" → "Wave-ordered execution"; "in parallel" removed from diagnose-issues description
- **`new-project.md`** — "Spawn 4 parallel research efforts (as subagents or sequential deep reads)" → "Run 4 research passes sequentially"
- **`agents/planner.md`** — wave frontmatter comment, Wave 1 description, and file-conflict rule all use "independent" / "dependency ordering" instead of "parallel"
- **`agents/debugger.md`** — "diagnosing multiple UAT gaps in parallel" → "diagnosing multiple UAT gaps"
- **`references/model-profiles.md`** — "Orchestrators resolve model before spawning" / "Pass model parameter to Task call" replaced with plain resolution logic

---

## [v1.2.1] — Accuracy pass: correct promises, real skill commands

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **README `## Design System`** — replaced 13 fictional commands (`/motion`, `/tokens`, `/brand`, `/typography`, etc.) with the 17 real impeccable skill commands (`/audit`, `/critique`, `/polish`, `/normalize`, `/colorize`, `/animate`, `/bolder`, `/quieter`, `/distill`, `/clarify`, `/optimize`, `/harden`, `/delight`, `/extract`, `/adapt`, `/onboard`, `/teach-impeccable`)
- **README file tree** — `skills/` entry updated to show `impeccable/` subfolder with skill breakdown
- **All workflows (44 occurrences)** — `AGENTIC DEV ►` banner prefix replaced with `learnship ►` (missed in v1.2.0 sweep)
- **`execute-phase.md`** — removed false parallelism claims; wave model accurately described as dependency-ordered sequential execution
- **`plan-phase.md`** — "run in parallel" → "independent, execute in any order"

- **`diagnose-issues.md`** — "in parallel" removed from frontmatter description
- **README diagrams and tables** — all `parallel execution` / `parallel agents` language replaced with accurate Windsurf single-agent equivalents
- **`impeccable/audit` and `impeccable/critique`** — `{{available_commands}}` placeholder resolved to full list of real skill commands

---

## [v1.2.0] — Original Work: GSD scrubbed, impeccable skill integrated

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`frontend-design` skill** — now uses the full upstream [impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable) skill by @pbakaus: all 7 domain-specific reference files (typography, color, spatial, motion, interaction, responsive, ux-writing) with their complete content and 17 commands (`/audit`, `/critique`, `/polish`, `/colorize`, `/animate`, etc.)
- **`SKILL.md`** attribution updated to credit pbakaus/impeccable correctly

### Changed

- **All GSD/get-shit-done references removed** — learnship is now fully original work:
  - `references/model-profiles.md` — agent names renamed (e.g. `gsd-planner` → `planner`), Claude Code-specific notes removed
  - `references/planning-config.md` — `gsd-tools.cjs` binary calls replaced with plain `git` + `python3` bash commands; branch templates no longer prefixed with `gsd/`
  - `references/git-integration.md` — all `gsd-tools.cjs` commit commands replaced with plain `git add` + `git commit`
  - `references/ui-brand.md` — `GSD ►` banner prefix replaced with `learnship ►`
  - `references/verification-patterns.md` — stale `~/.claude/get-shit-done/` path reference removed

  - `templates/project.md` — `/gsd:map-codebase` → `/map-codebase`
  - `.windsurf/workflows/quick.md` — frontmatter description updated
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — `gsd-tools.cjs` binary call guidance removed
  - `README.md` — impeccable credit URL corrected to `pbakaus/impeccable`

### Fixed

- **`SKILL.md`** — removed `{{model}}` Claude-specific template variable (not supported in Windsurf)

---

## [v1.1.0] — Install & Workflow Fixes

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`new-project`** — `.windsurf/` is now automatically added to `.gitignore` on every new and existing project, preventing AI platform files from being tracked in user repos
- **`new-project`** — new `commit_mode` configuration option: `auto` (default, commit after each workflow step) or `manual` (skip all git commits, user commits when ready)
- **`templates/config.json`** — new `commit_mode` field with default `auto`
- **Tests** — 3 test suites (`validate_package.sh`, `validate_workflows.sh`, `validate_skills.sh`) with 50 automated checks covering all required files, all 39 workflows, skills structure, and installer
- **CI** — GitHub Actions: 3 jobs — `test`, `lint-shell` (shellcheck), `validate-json`; `npm test` runs the full suite
- **`LICENSE`** — MIT license file
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** — Contributor Covenant

### Fixed

- **`npx` installer** — project install now correctly targets the user's working directory instead of the npx cache (`INIT_CWD` → `LEARNSHIP_INSTALL_CWD`)
- **`install.sh`** — added `realpath` guard to prevent `cp: same file` errors
- **README** — Mermaid diagram node labels now use `<br/>` instead of `\n` (GitHub requires `<br/>` for line breaks inside nodes)
- **README** — CI badge includes `?branch=main` and links to the workflow run page
- **CI** — `run_all.sh` exit code fixed: `set -e` + `((VAR++))` caused false failure when counter was 0

---
