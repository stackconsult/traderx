## What is learnship?

learnship is an **agent harness** for anyone who wants to build, learn, and ship real products using AI agents. It's the scaffolding that makes your AI coding agent actually reliable across real projects.

Every serious AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Manus, Devin) converges on the same architecture: a simple execution loop wraps the model, and the **harness** decides what information reaches the model, when, and how. The model is interchangeable. The harness is the product.

learnship gives you that harness as a portable, open-source layer that runs inside Windsurf, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, or Codex CLI and adds three things your agent doesn't have by default:

- **Persistent memory.** `/new-project` generates an `AGENTS.md` at your project root. Windsurf, Claude Code, and Cursor load it automatically every session; on other platforms the workflows reference it explicitly. No more repeating yourself.
- **Structured process.** A repeatable phase loop (Discuss → Plan → Execute → Verify → Review → Ship → Compound) with spec-driven plans, wave-ordered execution, and UAT-driven verification. The harness controls what context reaches the agent at each step.
- **Knowledge compounding (v2.0).** `/compound` captures solved problems as searchable documentation. `/review` runs multi-persona code review. `/challenge` stress-tests scope. `/ship` runs the full delivery pipeline. `/ideate` generates codebase-grounded ideas. `/guard` adds safety mode. `/sync-docs` detects stale documentation.
- **Built-in learning.** Neuroscience-backed checkpoints at every phase transition so you understand what you shipped, not just that you shipped it.

---

## What problem does it solve?

If you've used AI coding assistants for more than a few sessions, you've hit this wall:

> The agent forgets everything. Each session starts from scratch. Decisions get repeated. Code quality drifts. You ship fast but understand less. The more you rely on the AI, the less you own the outcome.

This is a **harness problem**, not a model problem. Research shows the same model on the same benchmark scores 42% with one scaffold and 78% with another. Cursor's lazy context loading cuts token usage by 47%. Vercel deleted 80% of their agent's tools and watched it go from failing tasks to completing them. Same model. The only variable is the harness.

learnship solves this with **progressive disclosure**, the pattern that separates working agents from impressive demos. Context is revealed incrementally, not dumped upfront. The right files, decisions, and phase context reach the agent exactly when needed, nothing more.

| Without learnship | With learnship |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Context resets every session | `AGENTS.md` loaded automatically every conversation |
| Ad-hoc prompts, unpredictable results | Spec-driven plans, verifiable deliverables |
| Architectural decisions get forgotten | `DECISIONS.md` tracked and honored by the agent |
| Everything dumped into context at once | Phase-scoped context: only what this step needs |
| You ship code you don't fully understand | Learning checkpoints build real understanding at every step |
| UI looks generic, AI-generated | `impeccable` design system prevents AI aesthetic slop |

---

## Who is it for?

learnship is built for **anyone who wants to build and ship real products with AI agents**, not just developers. If you're a founder, designer, researcher, or maker who uses AI tools to build things, this is for you.

It's the right tool if:

- You're **building a real project** (not just experimenting) and want the AI to stay aligned across sessions
- You're **learning while building** and want to actually understand what gets shipped
- You care about **code quality and UI quality** beyond "it works"
- You want **parallel agent execution** on Claude Code, OpenCode, or Gemini CLI to ship phases faster
- You've felt the frustration of **context loss**: repeating yourself every session while the agent forgets past decisions

It's probably overkill if you just need one-off scripts or quick fixes. Use `/quick` for that.

## ⚡ Get Started in 30 Seconds

### 1. Install

![Install learnship](assets/install.png)

**Requirements:** Node.js ≥ 18, Git. [Details →](https://faviovazquez.github.io/learnship/getting-started/installation/#requirements)

**Via npm (all platforms — recommended):**

```bash
npx learnship
```

The installer auto-detects your platform. Choose **global** (all projects) or **local** (current project only):

```bash
npx learnship --global   # all projects
npx learnship --local    # this project only
```

**Via platform marketplace (no terminal required):**

```bash
# Claude Code — community marketplace
/plugin marketplace add FavioVazquez/learnship-marketplace
/plugin install learnship@learnship-marketplace

# Cursor — after marketplace approval
/add-plugin learnship

# Gemini CLI — native extension
gemini extensions install https://github.com/FavioVazquez/learnship
```

Or specify your platform explicitly. See [Platform Support](#-platform-support) below.

### Why `npx learnship`?

learnship is published to npm — `npx learnship` pulls the latest release directly. No `github:` prefix, no clone needed, no version pinning. The same `bin/install.js` runs regardless of whether you install via npm, marketplace, or native extension.

### 2. Start your AI agent and type

```
/ls
```

(or the platform equivalent; see the table below). `/ls` detects whether you have a project, walks you through starting one if not, or tells you exactly where you are and what to do next.

## 🌐 Platform Support

learnship works on **6 platforms**. Pick your tool:

| Platform | Install command | Invoke commands as |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Windsurf** | `npx learnship --windsurf --global` | `/ls`, `/new-project` |
| **Claude Code** | `npx learnship --claude --global` | `/learnship:ls`, `/learnship:new-project` |
| **Cursor** | `/add-plugin learnship` *(after marketplace approval)* | `@learnship` rules load automatically |
| **OpenCode** | `npx learnship --opencode --global` | `/learnship-ls`, `/learnship-new-project` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `npx learnship --gemini --global` | `/learnship:ls`, `/learnship:new-project` |
| **Codex CLI** | `npx learnship --codex --global` | `$learnship-ls`, `$learnship-new-project` |

```bash
# All platforms at once
npx learnship --all --global
```

### 🤖 Platform capabilities

Each platform gets the best experience it supports:

| Feature | Windsurf | Claude Code | OpenCode | Gemini CLI | Codex CLI |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Slash commands | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | `$skills` |
| Real parallel subagents | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Parallel wave execution | — | ✓ opt-in | ✓ opt-in | ✓ | ✓ opt-in |
| Specialist agent pool | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Skills (native `@invoke`) | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| Skills (context files) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**What "parallel subagents" means:** On Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex, `execute-phase` can spawn a dedicated executor agent per plan within a wave, each with its own full 200k context budget. Plans in the same wave run in parallel. Enable with `"parallelization": true` in `.planning/config.json`. All platforms default to sequential (always safe).

## 🗺️ The 5 Commands You Actually Need

![5 commands diagram](assets/quick-start-flow.png)

learnship has 49 workflows. You don't need to know them all. Start with these five and everything else surfaces naturally from `/ls`.

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/ls` | Show status, recent work, and next step (and offer to run it) | **Start every session here** |
| `/next` | Read state and immediately run the right next workflow | When you just want to keep moving |
| `/new-project` | Full init: questions → research → requirements → roadmap | Starting a new project |
| `/quick "..."` | One-off task with atomic commits, no planning ceremony | Small fixes, experiments |
| `/help` | All 49 workflows organized by category | Discovering capabilities |

> **Tip:** `/ls` works for both new and returning users. New user with no project? It explains learnship and offers to run `/new-project`. Returning user? It shows your progress and suggests exactly what to do next.

---

## 🔄 The Phase Loop

![Phase loop](assets/phase-loop.png)

Once you have a project, every feature ships through a 7-step phase loop:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    DP["/discuss-phase N<br/>Capture decisions"]
    PP["/plan-phase N<br/>Research + plans"]
    EP["/execute-phase N<br/>Build + commit"]
    VW["/verify-work N<br/>UAT + diagnose"]
    RV["/review<br/>Multi-persona review"]
    SH["/ship<br/>Test → PR"]
    CP["/compound<br/>Capture knowledge"]

    DP --> PP --> EP --> VW
    VW --> RV --> SH --> CP
    CP -->|"next phase"| DP
    VW -->|"all done"| DONE["✓ /complete-milestone"]
```

| Step | Command | What happens |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **1. Discuss** | `/discuss-phase N` | You and the agent align on implementation decisions before any code |
| **2. Plan** | `/plan-phase N` | Agent researches the domain, creates executable plans, verifies them |
| **3. Execute** | `/execute-phase N` | Plans run in dependency order, one atomic commit per task |
| **4. Verify** | `/verify-work N` | You do UAT; agent diagnoses any gaps and creates fix plans |
| **5. Review** | `/review` | Multi-persona code review through 6 lenses (v2.0) |
| **6. Ship** | `/ship` | Test → lint → commit → push → PR (v2.0) |
| **7. Compound** | `/compound` | Capture what you learned as searchable documentation (v2.0) |

**Just starting?** `/ls` or `/next` will route you into the right step automatically.

## 🏗️ How It Works

![How it works](assets/how-it-works.png)

Three integrated layers that reinforce each other:

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Workflow Engine** | Spec-driven phases → context-engineered plans → wave-ordered execution → verified delivery |
| **Learning Partner** | Neuroscience-backed checkpoints at every phase transition: retrieval, reflection, spacing, struggle |
| **Design System** | 21 impeccable steering commands for production-grade UI: `/audit`, `/critique`, `/polish`, and more |

```mermaid
graph LR
    WE["Workflow Engine<br/>Spec-driven phases<br/>Context-engineered plans<br/>Atomic execution"] --> LP["Learning Partner<br/>Neuroscience-backed<br/>Woven into workflows<br/>Builds real understanding"]
    WE --> DS["Design System<br/>Production-grade UI<br/>Impeccable aesthetics<br/>Anti-AI-slop standards"]
    LP --> DS
    DS --> LP
```

## 🆚 Agentic Engineering vs Vibe Coding

![Vibe coding vs Agentic engineering](assets/vibe-vs-agentic.png)

| | Vibe coding | Agentic engineering |
|-|------------|--------------------|
| **Context** | Resets every session | Engineered into every agent call |
| **Decisions** | Implicit, forgotten | Tracked in `DECISIONS.md`, honored by the agent |
| **Plans** | Ad-hoc prompts | Spec-driven, verifiable, wave-ordered |
| **Outcome** | Code you shipped | Code you shipped **and understand** |

---

## 🧠 Context Engineering

![Context engineering](assets/context-engineering.png)

Every agent invocation in learnship is loaded with structured context. Nothing is guessed:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph CONTEXT["Loaded into every agent call"]
        A["AGENTS.md<br/>Project soul + current phase"]
        B["REQUIREMENTS.md<br/>What we're building"]
        C["DECISIONS.md<br/>Every architectural choice"]
        D["Phase CONTEXT.md<br/>Implementation preferences"]
    end
    CONTEXT --> AGENT["AI Agent"]
    AGENT --> P["Executable PLAN.md"]
    AGENT --> S["Commits + SUMMARY.md"]
```

---

## 🗂️ AGENTS.md: Persistent Project Memory

![AGENTS.md](assets/agents-md.png)

`/new-project` generates an `AGENTS.md` at your project root. On Windsurf, Claude Code, and Cursor it is loaded automatically every session as a project rule. On OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI the learnship workflows reference it explicitly. Either way, the agent always knows the project, current phase, tech stack, and past decisions without you repeating yourself.

```
AGENTS.md                   ← your AI agent reads this every conversation
├── Soul & Principles        # Pair-programmer framing, 10 working principles
├── Platform Context         # Points to .planning/, explains the phase loop
├── Current Phase            # Updated automatically by workflows
├── Project Structure        # Filled during new-project from your answers
├── Tech Stack               # Filled from research results
└── Regressions              # Updated by /debug when bugs are fixed

|---------------------|---------------|---------|
| `none` | Never | Solo dev, simple projects |
| `phase` | At each `execute-phase` | Code review per phase |
| `milestone` | At first `execute-phase` | Release branches, PR per version |

### Model Profiles

| Agent | `quality` | `balanced` | `budget` |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Planner | large | large | medium |
| Executor | large | medium | medium |
| Phase Researcher | large | medium | small |
| Debugger | large | medium | medium |
| Verifier | medium | medium | small |
| Plan Checker | medium | medium | small |
| Solution Writer | medium | medium | small |
| Code Reviewer | large | medium | medium |
| Challenger | large | medium | medium |
| Ideation Agent | large | medium | small |

> **Platform note:** Tiers map to the best available model on your platform: `large` = Claude Opus 4.6 / Gemini 3.1 Pro / GPT-5.4, `medium` = Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Gemini 3.1 Flash / GPT-5.4-mini, `small` = Claude Haiku 4.5 / Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite / GPT-5.4-nano. Windsurf, Cursor, and OpenCode use the platform default model — tiers signal intended task complexity.

### Speed vs. Quality Presets

| Scenario | `mode` | `granularity` | `model_profile` | Research | Plan Check | Verifier |
|----------|--------|--------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------|
| Prototyping | `yolo` | `coarse` | `budget` | off | off | off |

## 🧩 Learning Partner

The learning partner is woven into the platform, not bolted on. It fires at natural workflow transitions to build genuine understanding, not just fluent answers.

### How it fires

```
learning_mode: "auto"    → offered automatically at checkpoints (default)
learning_mode: "manual"  → only when you explicitly invoke @agentic-learning
```

### All 11 actions

| Action | Trigger | What it does |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `@agentic-learning learn [topic]` | Any time | Active retrieval: explain before seeing, then fill gaps |
| `@agentic-learning quiz [topic]` | Any time | 3-5 questions, one at a time, formative feedback |
| `@agentic-learning reflect` | After `execute-phase` | Three-question structured reflection: learned / goal / gaps |
| `@agentic-learning space` | After `verify-work` | Schedule concepts for spaced review → writes `docs/revisit.md` |
| `@agentic-learning brainstorm [topic]` | After `new-project` | Collaborative design dialogue before any code |
| `@agentic-learning struggle [topic]` | During `quick` | Hint ladder: try first, reveal only when needed |
| `@agentic-learning either-or` | After `discuss-phase` | Decision journal: paths considered, choice, rationale |
| `@agentic-learning explain-first` | Any time | Oracy exercise: you explain, agent gives structured feedback |
| `@agentic-learning explain [topic]` | Any time | Project comprehension log → writes `docs/project-knowledge.md` |
| `@agentic-learning interleave` | Any time | Mixed retrieval across multiple topics |
| `@agentic-learning cognitive-load [topic]` | After `plan-phase` | Decompose overwhelming scope into working-memory steps |

**Core principle:** Fluent answers from an AI are not the same as learning. Every action makes you do the cognitive work, with support rather than shortcuts.

### Skills across platforms

| Platform | How `agentic-learning` works |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| **Windsurf** | Native skill: invoke with `@agentic-learning learn`, `@agentic-learning quiz`, etc. |
| **Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI** | Installed as a context file in `learnship/skills/agentic-learning/`. The AI reads and applies the techniques automatically. Reference it explicitly with `use the agentic-learning skill` or just work normally and it activates at checkpoints. |

---

## 🎨 Design System

The **impeccable** skill suite is always active as project context for any UI work. It provides design direction, anti-patterns, and 21 steering commands that prevent generic AI aesthetics. Based on [@pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable).

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/teach-impeccable` | One-time setup: gathers project design context and saves persistent guidelines |
| `/audit` | Comprehensive audit: accessibility, performance, theming, responsive design |
| `/critique` | UX critique: visual hierarchy, information architecture, emotional resonance |
| `/polish` | Final quality pass: alignment, spacing, consistency before shipping |
| `/normalize` | Normalize design to match your design system for consistency |
| `/colorize` | Add strategic color to monochromatic or flat interfaces |
| `/animate` | Add purposeful animations and micro-interactions |
| `/bolder` | Amplify safe or boring designs for more visual impact |
| `/quieter` | Tone down overly aggressive designs to reduce intensity and gain refinement |
| `/distill` | Strip to essence: remove complexity, clarify what matters |
| `/clarify` | Improve UX copy, error messages, microcopy, labels |
| `/optimize` | Performance: loading speed, rendering, animations, bundle size |
| `/harden` | Resilience: error handling, i18n, text overflow, edge cases |
| `/delight` | Add moments of joy and personality that make interfaces memorable |
| `/extract` | Extract reusable components and design tokens into your design system |
| `/adapt` | Adapt designs across screen sizes, devices, and contexts |
| `/onboard` | Design onboarding flows, empty states, first-time user experiences |

**The AI Slop Test:** If you showed the interface to someone and said "AI made this", would they believe you immediately? If yes, that's the problem. Use `/critique` to find out.

### learnship integration

**Automatic UI standards during `execute-phase`:** When a phase involves UI work, learnship detects it automatically and activates `@impeccable frontend-design` principles before any code is written. You'll see a banner announcing it. The agent then applies typography, color, layout, and component standards across every task in the phase — not as a post-hoc review but as an active constraint during execution.

**Post-action milestone recommendation:** After any impeccable action produces recommendations, the agent suggests running `/new-milestone` to create a dedicated "UI Polish" milestone. This turns impeccable findings into versioned, traceable phases with plans and commits — so improvements don't disappear into chat history. Applying directly is always an option too.

### Skills across platforms

| Platform | How `impeccable` works |
|----------|-----------------------|
| **Windsurf** | Native skills: invoke each command directly with `/audit`, `/polish`, `/critique`, etc. |
| **Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI** | Installed as context files in `learnship/skills/impeccable/`. The AI reads design principles and anti-patterns automatically. Reference commands explicitly with `run the /audit impeccable skill` or just ask for UI work and it applies the standards. |

## 🧭 Decision Intelligence

Every project accumulates decisions: architecture choices, library picks, scope trade-offs. The platform tracks them in a structured register so future sessions understand *why* the project is built the way it is.

**`.planning/DECISIONS.md`** is the decision register:
```markdown
## DEC-001: Use Zustand over Redux
Date: 2026-03-01 | Phase: 2 | Type: library
Context: Needed client-side state for dashboard filters
Options: Zustand (simple, no boilerplate), Redux (complex, overkill for scope)
Choice: Zustand
Rationale: 3x less boilerplate, sufficient for current data flow complexity
Consequences: Locks React as UI framework; migration would require state rewrite
Status: active
```

**Populated automatically by:**
- `discuss-phase` surfaces prior decisions before each phase discussion
- `plan-phase` reads decisions before creating plans (never contradicts active ones)
- `debug` puts architectural lessons from bugs into the register
- `decision-log` manually captures any decision from any conversation

**Queried by:**
- `audit-milestone` checks decisions were honored in implementation
- `knowledge-base` aggregates all decisions into a searchable `KNOWLEDGE.md`

## 📁 Planning Artifacts

Every project creates a structured `.planning/` directory:

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Project already initialized"
`/new-project` found `.planning/PROJECT.md` already exists. If you want to start over, delete `.planning/` first. To continue, use `/progress` or `/resume-work`.

### Context degradation during long sessions
Start each major workflow with a fresh context. The platform is designed around fresh context windows; every agent gets a clean slate. Use `/resume-work` or `/progress` to restore state after clearing.

### Plans seem wrong or misaligned
Run `/discuss-phase [N]` before planning. Most plan quality issues come from unresolved gray areas. Run `/list-phase-assumptions [N]` to see the intended approach before committing to a plan.

### Execution produces stubs or incomplete code
Plans with more than 3 tasks are too large for reliable single-context execution. Re-plan with smaller scope: `/plan-phase [N]` with finer granularity.

### Lost track of where you are
Run `/ls`. It reads all state files, shows your progress, and offers to run the next step.

### Need to change something after execution
Use `/quick` for targeted fixes, or `/verify-work` to systematically identify and fix issues through UAT. Do not re-run `/execute-phase` on a phase that already has summaries.

### Costs running too high
Switch to budget profile via `/settings`. Disable research and plan-check for familiar domains. Use `granularity: "coarse"` for fewer, broader phases.

### Working on a private/sensitive project
Set `commit_docs: false` during `/new-project` or via `/settings`. Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore`. Planning artifacts stay local.

### Something broke and I don't know why
Run `/debug "description of what's broken"`. It runs triage → root cause diagnosis → fix planning with a persistent debug session.

### Phase passed UAT but has known gaps
Run `/audit-milestone` to surface all gaps, then `/plan-milestone-gaps` to create fix phases before release.
