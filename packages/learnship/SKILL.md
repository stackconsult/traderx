# learnship

You are working inside a project that uses **learnship** — a multi-platform agentic engineering system for building real products with spec-driven workflows, integrated learning, and impeccable design.

## Platform Overview

This platform provides three integrated layers:

1. **Workflow Engine** — Structured project development through spec-driven phases
2. **Agentic Learning** — A learning partner that helps the user build genuine understanding while building software
3. **Frontend Design** — Impeccable UI quality for any user-facing work

## Active Workflows

The following workflows are available as platform slash commands (Windsurf) or commands (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex). Suggest the appropriate one when relevant:

| Workflow | When to suggest |
|----------|----------------|
| `/new-project` | User wants to start a new project from scratch |
| `/discuss-phase [N]` | Before planning a phase — capture user's implementation vision |
| `/plan-phase [N]` | After discussing a phase — create executable plans |
| `/execute-phase [N]` | Plans exist and are ready to run |
| `/verify-work [N]` | Phase execution complete — time for user acceptance testing |
| `/ls` | User asks "where are we?", "what's next?", or starts a new session — primary entry point |
| `/next` | User wants to just keep moving without deciding what to do |
| `/quick [task]` | Small ad-hoc task that doesn't need full phase ceremony |
| `/progress` | Same as `/ls` — status overview and routing |
| `/pause-work` | User is stopping mid-phase |
| `/resume-work` | User is returning to an in-progress project |
| `/complete-milestone` | All phases in the current milestone are done |
| `/compound` | Just solved a problem or learned a pattern — capture it while fresh |
| `/review` | Code ready for review — multi-persona quality check |
| `/challenge` | About to commit to a milestone or big feature — stress-test the scope |
| `/ship` | Tests pass, code reviewed — ship it (test → lint → commit → push → PR) |
| `/ideate` | Looking for what to build next — codebase-grounded idea generation |
| `/guard` | Working on sensitive files — enable safety mode |
| `/sync-docs` | After code changes — detect stale documentation |

## Planning Artifacts

All project state lives in `.planning/`. Key files:

- `.planning/config.json` — Settings including `learning_mode` ("auto" or "manual")
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — Vision, requirements, key decisions
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — Phase-by-phase delivery plan
- `.planning/STATE.md` — Current position, decisions, blockers
- `.planning/phases/[N]-[slug]/` — Per-phase artifacts (CONTEXT, RESEARCH, PLANs, SUMMARYs, UAT, VERIFICATION)

Always read STATE.md and ROADMAP.md before any planning or execution operation to understand current project position.

## Agent Personas

Reference these files when adopting a specific role:

- `@./agents/planner.md` — Creating PLAN.md files
- `@./agents/researcher.md` — Researching domain or phase
- `@./agents/executor.md` — Implementing plans (atomic commits, no scope creep)
- `@./agents/verifier.md` — Verifying plans or phase goal achievement
- `@./agents/debugger.md` — Diagnosing root causes (read-only, never fix)
- `@./agents/solution-writer.md` — Writing solution documents for `.planning/solutions/`
- `@./agents/code-reviewer.md` — Multi-persona code review through specific lenses
- `@./agents/challenger.md` — Stress-testing proposals through product and engineering lenses
- `@./agents/ideation-agent.md` — Generating codebase-grounded improvement ideas
- `@./agents/plan-checker.md` — Verifying PLAN.md completeness, goal coverage, wave correctness

## Learning Mode

Read `learning_mode` from `.planning/config.json` (default: "auto"):

- **`auto`** — Proactively offer learning actions at natural workflow checkpoints (after planning, execution, verification)
- **`manual`** — Only activate `@agentic-learning` when the user explicitly asks

Learning checkpoints:
- After requirements approved → `@agentic-learning brainstorm`
- After discuss-phase → `@agentic-learning either-or`
- After plan-phase → `@agentic-learning cognitive-load`
- After execute-phase → `@agentic-learning reflect`
- After verify-work passes → `@agentic-learning space`
- After `/review` → `@agentic-learning learn` (review findings as learning material)
- After `/challenge` → `@agentic-learning either-or` (which lens was most valuable?)
- After `/ship` → `@agentic-learning reflect` (what went well in this cycle?)
- After `/ideate` → `@agentic-learning brainstorm` (explore top idea collaboratively)
- During complex quick tasks → `@agentic-learning struggle`

## Design Skill

The `impeccable` skill suite is always available for any UI work. Use its steering commands (`/audit`, `/critique`, `/polish`, `/colorize`, `/animate`, `/bolder`, `/quieter`, `/distill`, `/clarify`, `/optimize`, `/harden`, `/delight`, `/extract`, `/adapt`, `/onboard`, `/normalize`, `/teach-impeccable`) when reviewing or building user-facing interfaces.

## Mandatory Gate — No Project, No Work

**Before responding to any user message, check:**

```
Does .planning/PROJECT.md exist?
```

- **No** → The project has not been initialized. **Do NOT implement anything.** Tell the user:

  > "This project hasn't been set up with learnship yet. Run `/new-project` to initialize it — that takes about 10 minutes and sets up the spec, roadmap, and phase structure before any code gets written.
  >
  > This is not optional: working without a spec means building the wrong thing. `/new-project` first."

  Then stop. Do not offer to help with the task. Do not say "but I can also just fix it directly." Wait for the user to run `/new-project`.

- **Yes** → Continue normally. Apply the workflow routing logic from `AGENTS.md`.

**This gate applies to ALL messages** — bug reports, feature requests, "quick fixes", detailed specs, anything. The only exception: if the user is currently mid-ceremony in `/new-project` (i.e., they are answering your questions), their messages are workflow answers, not tasks to route.

## Key Behaviors

- **Context efficiency**: Reference file paths rather than inlining file contents. Load context fresh when needed rather than carrying it forward.
- **Atomic commits**: Every task gets its own commit. Never batch unrelated changes.
- **No scope creep**: Execute exactly what plans say. Document deviations in SUMMARY.md.
- **Goal-backward verification**: Check that `must_haves` are met in the codebase, not just that tasks ran.
- **Deferred ideas**: When users suggest things outside the current phase scope, note them for the roadmap backlog — don't act on them immediately.
