# Contributing

learnship is built in the open. Contributions: new workflows, skill improvements, platform support, bug fixes, and documentation: are welcome.

## Adding a new workflow

1. Create `.windsurf/workflows/[name].md` with YAML frontmatter:

    ```markdown
    ---
    description: One-line description of what this workflow does
    ---

    # Workflow Name

    [Steps...]

    ## Learning Checkpoint

    Read `learning_mode` from `.planning/config.json`.

    **If `auto`:** Offer:

    > 💡 **Learning moment:** [context-appropriate action]
    >
    > `@agentic-learning [action] [topic]`: [why this action, why now]

    **If `manual`:** Add quietly: *"Tip: `@agentic-learning [action]` to [benefit]."*
    ```

2. **Sync to installed payload:**

    ```bash
    cp .windsurf/workflows/[name].md learnship/workflows/[name].md
    ```

3. **Add to `help.md`** in both `.windsurf/workflows/` and `learnship/workflows/`.

4. **Add tests.** New workflows need at least:
    - File exists check in both locations
    - Source and installed copies are identical
    - Frontmatter description is present
    - Learning Checkpoint has both `auto` and `manual` branches

5. **Run the test suite:**

    ```bash
    bash tests/validate_multiplatform.sh
    ```

---

## Learning Checkpoint requirements

Every workflow **must** have a Learning Checkpoint at the end. Requirements verified by the test suite:

- `## Learning Checkpoint` section present
- Reads `learning_mode` from `.planning/config.json`
- Has `**If \`auto\`:**` branch with at least one `@agentic-learning` action
- Has `**If \`manual\`:**` branch with a quiet tip
- Action chosen matches the workflow context (see [Skills → Learning Partner](skills/agentic-learning.md))

---

## Syncing .windsurf/ and learnship/

The `.windsurf/workflows/` directory is the **source of truth**. `learnship/workflows/` is the installed payload that must stay in sync. The test suite checks every modified workflow for sync.

```bash
# Sync a single workflow
cp .windsurf/workflows/[name].md learnship/workflows/[name].md

# Sync all workflows
for f in .windsurf/workflows/*.md; do
  cp "$f" learnship/workflows/$(basename "$f")
done
```

---

## Versioning

learnship uses strict semver:

| Type | Bump | Examples |
|------|------|---------|
| Bug fixes, doc corrections, test additions, workflow enrichments | **PATCH** `x.x.N` | Fix a broken step, add learning actions |
| New workflows, new skills, new platforms | **MINOR** `x.N.0` | Add a new workflow file, new platform support |
| Breaking changes, major restructuring | **MAJOR** `N.0.0` | Change the planning artifact schema |

Every PR must include:
- Version bump in `package.json`
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry with date and summary
- All tests passing

---

## Running the tests

```bash
bash tests/validate_multiplatform.sh
```

The suite has 5 sections covering:
- Installer correctness across all 6 platforms
- Workflow structure and sync
- Skills installation
- Learning Checkpoint coverage
- Documentation site integrity

313+ checks. All must pass before merging.

## PR workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
# make changes
bash tests/validate_multiplatform.sh    # must pass
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: [description] (vX.Y.Z)"
git push origin feat/your-feature
# open PR → label with enhancement/bug/documentation
```
