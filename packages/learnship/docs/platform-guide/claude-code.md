# Claude Code

Claude Code gets full learnship capabilities including real parallel subagents, specialist agent dispatch, and the complete workflow suite.

## Install

```bash
npx learnship --claude --global
```

Installs to `~/.claude/learnship/`.

Alternatively, install via the community marketplace (no terminal required):

```
/plugin marketplace add FavioVazquez/learnship-marketplace
/plugin install learnship@learnship-marketplace
```

## Invoke commands

All learnship workflows use the `/learnship:` prefix:

```
/learnship:ls
/learnship:new-project
/learnship:discuss-phase 1
/learnship:plan-phase 1
/learnship:execute-phase 1
/learnship:verify-work 1
/learnship:quick "fix the login bug"
/learnship:help
/learnship:review              # v2.0: multi-persona code review
/learnship:ship                # v2.0: test → commit → push → PR
/learnship:compound            # v2.0: capture solved problem as knowledge
/learnship:challenge           # v2.0: stress-test scope
/learnship:ideate              # v2.0: codebase-grounded idea generation
```

## Skills

Skills are installed as **native Claude Code skills** — they appear as first-class slash commands immediately after install:

```
~/.claude/skills/
├── agentic-learning/
│   ├── SKILL.md           ← native skill, all actions inline
│   └── references/        ← supplementary detail files
└── impeccable/
    └── SKILL.md           ← all 21 sub-skill bodies inlined
```

Invoke with slash commands:

```
/agentic-learning learn React hooks
/agentic-learning quiz
/agentic-learning either-or
/agentic-learning brainstorm my auth design
/impeccable audit
/impeccable polish
/impeccable critique
```

Or just work normally: skills activate at workflow checkpoints when `learning_mode: "auto"`.

## Parallel subagents

Claude Code supports real parallel subagents. Enable in your project:

```json title=".planning/config.json"
{ "parallelization": true }
```

When enabled:
- `plan-phase` spawns three dedicated subagents (researcher, planner, plan-checker) each with a fresh 200k context budget
- `execute-phase` dispatches each independent plan to its own executor agent: plans in the same wave run in parallel
- `debug` spawns a dedicated debugger subagent for deep root-cause investigation
- `review` spawns a code-reviewer subagent through 6 review lenses (v2.0)
- `challenge` spawns a challenger subagent for scope stress-testing (v2.0)
- `compound` spawns a solution-writer subagent to capture knowledge (v2.0)
- `ideate` spawns an ideation-agent for codebase-grounded idea generation (v2.0)

## Capabilities

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Slash commands | ✅ `/learnship:*` prefix |
| `/agentic-learning` skill | ✅ Native skill (`~/.claude/skills/`) |
| `/impeccable` skill suite | ✅ Native skill, all 21 actions inlined |
| Parallel subagents | ✅ opt-in |
| Wave execution | ✅ opt-in |
| Specialist agent pool | ✅ |

## Tips

- **`AGENTS.md` is auto-loaded** by Claude Code as a project rule if placed at the project root.
- **Slash command prefix** is `/learnship:`: not `/learnship-` (that's OpenCode).
- **Subagents are opt-in.** Default is sequential which is always safe. Enable parallelization only after your first project works end-to-end.
