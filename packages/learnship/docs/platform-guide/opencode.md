# OpenCode

OpenCode gets full learnship capabilities including real parallel subagents and the complete workflow suite.

## Install

```bash
npx learnship --opencode --global
```

Installs to `~/.config/opencode/learnship/`.

## Invoke commands

All learnship workflows use the `/learnship-` prefix (hyphen, not colon):

```
/learnship-ls
/learnship-new-project
/learnship-discuss-phase 1
/learnship-plan-phase 1
/learnship-execute-phase 1
/learnship-verify-work 1
/learnship-quick "fix the login bug"
/learnship-help
/learnship-review              # v2.0: multi-persona code review
/learnship-ship                # v2.0: test → commit → push → PR
/learnship-compound            # v2.0: capture solved problem as knowledge
/learnship-challenge           # v2.0: stress-test scope
/learnship-ideate              # v2.0: codebase-grounded idea generation
```

## Skills

Skills are installed as context files:

```
~/.config/opencode/learnship/skills/
├── agentic-learning/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── references/
└── impeccable/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── [21 sub-skills]/
```

Reference explicitly to invoke:

```
Use the agentic-learning skill: learn [topic]
Run the impeccable /audit skill on this component
```

## Parallel subagents

OpenCode supports real parallel subagents. Enable:

```json title=".planning/config.json"
{ "parallelization": true }
```

When enabled, `execute-phase` dispatches each plan in a wave to its own dedicated agent with a fresh context budget.

## Capabilities

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Slash commands | ✅ `/learnship-*` prefix |
| `@agentic-learning` skill | ✅ Context file |
| `impeccable` skill suite | ✅ Context file |
| Parallel subagents | ✅ opt-in |
| Wave execution | ✅ opt-in |
| Specialist agent pool | ✅ |

!!! tip
    Note the **hyphen** separator in OpenCode commands (`/learnship-ls`) vs the **colon** in Claude Code and Gemini CLI (`/learnship:ls`).

!!! tip
    **`AGENTS.md` is not auto-loaded on OpenCode** the way it is on Windsurf or Claude Code. Run `/new-project` once per project — it generates an `AGENTS.md` at your project root. For subsequent sessions, OpenCode's agent will read it when the workflow commands explicitly reference it, but you can also add it to your OpenCode context manually for automatic loading.
