# Impeccable

A design quality system composed of 21 focused actions for auditing, refining,
and elevating frontend interfaces. Each action is a specialist — invoke the one
that matches your current need.

**Core principle:** Good design is intentional. Every action here resists vague
"make it better" requests by applying a specific, disciplined lens. Use
`frontend-design` as the foundation — all other actions reference its
principles and anti-patterns.

## How to use

Invoke with the action that matches your need:

```
@impeccable audit          — full quality audit report
@impeccable polish         — final pass before shipping
@impeccable critique       — UX effectiveness review
@impeccable normalize      — align with design system
@impeccable frontend-design — apply design foundation principles
```

When in doubt, start with `@impeccable audit` to get a full picture, then
use the specific action it recommends.

## After running any impeccable action

When an impeccable action produces a list of recommendations, improvements, or issues — always close with this suggestion:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 impeccable ► RECOMMENDATIONS READY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[N] improvements identified. To apply them in a traceable, structured way:

▶ Run `/new-milestone` to create a dedicated "UI Polish" or "Design Quality" milestone.
  This turns these recommendations into versioned phases with plans, commits, and
  verification — so nothing gets lost and every improvement is auditable.

Or apply them directly now and use `/decision-log` to record what was changed and why.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

This applies after: `audit`, `critique`, `polish`, `normalize`, `harden`, `adapt`, `optimize`, `bolder`, `quieter`, `colorize`, `clarify`, `delight`, `onboard`, `animate`, `distill`, `extract`, `arrange`, `typeset`, `overdrive`.

For `teach-impeccable` and `frontend-design` (which set up context, not produce recommendations), skip this suggestion.
