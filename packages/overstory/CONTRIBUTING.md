# Contributing to Overstory

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Overstory! This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/overstory.git
   cd overstory
   ```
3. **Install** dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
4. **Link** the CLI for local development:
   ```bash
   bun link
   ```
5. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/description-of-change
   ```

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with a category prefix:

- `fix/` -- Bug fixes
- `feat/` -- New features
- `docs/` -- Documentation changes
- `refactor/` -- Code refactoring
- `test/` -- Test additions or fixes

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
bun test                           # Run all tests
bun test src/config.test.ts        # Run a single test file
biome check .                      # Lint + format check
biome check --write .              # Auto-fix lint + format issues
tsc --noEmit                       # Type check
bun test && biome check . && tsc --noEmit  # All quality gates
```

Always run all three quality gates before submitting a PR.

## TypeScript Conventions

Overstory is a strict TypeScript project that runs directly on Bun (no build step).

### Strict Mode

- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is enabled -- always handle possible `undefined` from indexing
- `noExplicitAny` is an error -- use `unknown` and narrow, or define proper types
- `useConst` is enforced -- use `const` unless reassignment is needed
- `noNonNullAssertion` is a warning -- avoid `!` postfix, check for null/undefined instead

### Zero Runtime Dependencies

This is a hard rule. Use only Bun built-in APIs:

- `bun:sqlite` for databases
- `Bun.spawn` for subprocesses
- `Bun.file` for file I/O
- `Bun.write` for writes

External tools (`bd`, `mulch`, `git`, `tmux`) are invoked as subprocesses via `Bun.spawn`, never as npm imports.

### File Organization

- All shared types and interfaces go in `src/types.ts`
- All error types go in `src/errors.ts` and must extend `OverstoryError`
- Each CLI command gets its own file in `src/commands/`
- Each subsystem gets its own directory under `src/`

### Formatting

- **Tab indentation** (enforced by Biome)
- **100 character line width** (enforced by Biome)
- Biome handles import organization automatically

## Testing Conventions

- **No mocks** unless absolutely necessary. Tests use real filesystems, real SQLite, and real git repos.
- Create temp directories with `mkdtemp` for file I/O tests
- Use `:memory:` or temp file databases for SQLite tests
- Use real git repos in temp directories for worktree/merge tests
- Clean up in `afterEach`
- Tests are colocated with source files: `src/config.test.ts` alongside `src/config.ts`

**Only mock when the real thing has unacceptable side effects** (tmux sessions, external AI services, network requests). When mocking is necessary, document WHY in a comment at the top of the test file.

Example test structure:

```typescript
import { mkdtemp, rm } from "node:fs/promises";
import { join } from "node:path";
import { tmpdir } from "node:os";
import { afterEach, beforeEach, describe, it, expect } from "bun:test";

describe("my-feature", () => {
  let testDir: string;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    testDir = await mkdtemp(join(tmpdir(), "overstory-test-"));
  });

  afterEach(async () => {
    await rm(testDir, { recursive: true });
  });

  it("does the thing", async () => {
    // Write real files, run real code, assert real results
  });
});
```

Shared test utilities are available in `src/test-helpers.ts`:

- `createTempGitRepo()` -- Initialize a real git repo in a temp dir with initial commit
- `cleanupTempDir()` -- Remove temp directories
- `commitFile()` -- Add and commit a file to a test repo

## Adding a New Command

1. Create `src/commands/<name>.ts`
2. Register the command in `src/index.ts`
3. Add tests in `src/commands/<name>.test.ts`
4. Update the CLI Reference table in `README.md`

## Commit Message Style

Use concise, descriptive commit messages:

```
fix: resolve merge conflict detection for renamed files
feat: add dashboard live-refresh interval option
docs: update CLI reference with new nudge flags
```

Prefix with `fix:`, `feat:`, or `docs:` when the category is clear. Plain descriptive messages are also fine.

## Pull Request Expectations

- **One concern per PR.** Keep changes focused -- a bug fix, a feature, a refactor. Not all three.
- **Tests required.** New features and bug fixes should include tests. See the testing conventions above.
- **Passing CI.** All PRs must pass CI checks (lint + typecheck + test) before merge.
- **Description.** Briefly explain what the PR does and why. Link to any relevant issues.
